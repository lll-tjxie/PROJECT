       "[u'\\nWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\\nam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\\nhas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\\nand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\\nand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\\nKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\\nwatched them.I didn\\'t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\\nand I don\\'t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\\nas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\\npatrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\\nout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the\\ntime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\\nexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\\nthings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\\nsaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\\nit gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\\neach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\\nI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it\\'s technical merits - I don\\'t\\nreally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\\nor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\\nbest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\\nbut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\\ntakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nCan Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only,\\ncreate art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach\\nit\\nin a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a\\ndaunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable\\nmanagerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of\\nart in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting.\\nThese elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet\\nstill form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of\\nthe artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for\\nhis\\nnotable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his\\nfeature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself\\nalready a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most\\nrecognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The\\nShawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the\\nemotions,\\nand brings an era of artistically influential films back to\\nHollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\\nvictimized\\nby circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his\\nwife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a\\nlife sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in\\nthis prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls\\naround him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from\\nhis fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly\\nreferred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within\\nthe drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare\\nto\\nthe confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope\\ncauses\\nRed to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy\\nproves\\nto Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\\nprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\\nscreenplay\\npaved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with\\nthe phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella,\\nRita\\nHayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that\\nhe can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous\\npiece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many\\nways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas\\nwhere the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film\\ntransitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella,\\nDarabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of\\nemotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the\\ncunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred\\nNewman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing\\nNewman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as\\nif a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism\\nand tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score\\ncomposition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score\\nreceived an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent,\\nNewman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from\\nthe film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers,\\ncomposers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast\\nof The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The\\nmarvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most\\nconvincing\\nperformances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting\\nlies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear\\ninto their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James\\nWhitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man\\nincarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself\\nattached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these\\nactors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\\nmotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\\nanything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the\\nmost beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as\\nits focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope\\nand\\nfreedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly\\nyearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws\\nits\\naudience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart\\nwill go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions,\\nand deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a\\ngreat\\nnovel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply\\nentertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully,\\nillustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us\\na\\npoignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we\\nall seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it\\nlong lost in a dark sea of clich\\xe9s and predictability.  Darabont shows us\\nthat artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities.\\nThese artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires\\nyou to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The\\nShawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone\\nwho\\nrealizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still\\nlive on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we\\nwill never forget.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nIn its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank\\nDarabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\\nby Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked\\naway with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and\\nPulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is\\n20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and\\nRedemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however,\\nwas a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and\\nmaking its writer-director an American master after only two films. For\\nAndy Dufresne and Co., success didn\\'t come easy. Fortunately, failure\\nwasn\\'t a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell\\nfast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for\\nfailure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans\\ntoday, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a \\'Shawshank\\' was.\\nOn the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on\\n\"that \\'Rickshaw\\' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film\\'s a nightmare, as\\n\\'prison drama\\' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between\\ntwo best friends doesn\\'t spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie\\nis slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post,\\n\"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance\\nof narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is\\nthese same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a\\ntotal eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and\\nGothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts\\nits shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above\\nevery shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all\\nmemories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope.\\nIt\\'s in music, it\\'s in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here\\'s\\nwhere you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don\\'t forget.\\nForget that there are places in the world that aren\\'t made out of\\nstone. That there\\'s a - there\\'s a - there\\'s something inside that\\'s\\nyours, that they can\\'t touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn\\'t think much\\nof Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o\\' milk with the silver\\nspoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word,\\nand losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two\\nget to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This\\nagain, is one of the film\\'s major strengths. Many movies are about\\nlove, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the\\nonly one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two\\nbest friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship\\ntime and again, when it\\'s a feeling that weighs so much into everyone\\'s\\nday to day lives. Perhaps it\\'s too sentimental to seem conventional,\\nbut Shawshank\\'s core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film\\nis much better for it.It\\'s pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the\\nsame actors, it is easy to forget that the movie\\'s timeline spans well\\nover 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in\\nreality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it\\'s not as if the\\nfilm lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it\\'s going,\\nit merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off\\nas well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more\\nexhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be\\nforgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to\\nbe found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ\\nfigure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard\\nNixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they\\ncome. But if you aren\\'t looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to\\nanyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving\\nfilm, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don\\'t come much\\nbetter than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message\\nof hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved\\nthere is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran\\nsolely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of\\n1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb\\'s Top 250 Films, occasionally\\nswapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time --\\nredemption indeed. If you haven\\'t seen it yet, what the hell are you\\nwaiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes down a simple choice, really.\\nEither get busy living, or get busy dying.\"\\n',\n",

The\\ncinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the\\nsheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all\\nother\\nfilms, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story\\nand the way in which it unravels. It\\'s a powerful, poignant,\\nthought-provoking, challenging film like no other.

As well as a very\\nsurprising \"twist\" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If\\nyou have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it.

       " u'\\n\\nOne of the finest films made in recent years. It\\'s a poignant story\\nabout hope. Hope gets me. That\\'s what makes a film like this more than a\\nmovie. It tells a lesson about life.\\nThose are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It\\'s\\nalso a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, \\nfrom rule, from bigotry and hate.

       " u\"\\nMisery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now\\nyou can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the\\nfirst to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on\\nthe IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure\\nit could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the\\nfilm because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that\\nwhat I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote\\nit.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the\\nCastle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his\\nbest adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was\\nbrilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned\\nMisery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes\\nonto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to\\nunderstand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it\\nconveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim\\nRobbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he\\nnever loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man\\nagain. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane,\\nbut it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a\\ndifferent feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and\\nI don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been\\nsaid, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best\\npicture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or\\nShawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will\\nbe appreciated for years to come.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies\\nI have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better\\nthan it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen\\nKing is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul\\nand moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it\\nin his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is\\nso top-rate it\\'s almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the\\nmurder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy\\'s relationship with \"Red\"\\nRedding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to\\nescape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as\\nWarden Norton, and there are great\\nperformances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows\\n(late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy\\'s who\\nsuffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven\\'t seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW.

This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built\\non from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.\\nTim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was\\ninspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just\\nmade me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted\\nof murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but\\nyet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\"\\nRedding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest\\nperformance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep\\nregret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain\\naway is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with\\nAndy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy\\nalso becomes friends with the rest of Red\\'s group. James Whitmore also\\ngave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole\\nbut in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this\\nmovie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great\\ncinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but\\nnot in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares\\nmentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Some\\nfriends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over\\nthe summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we\\nhad heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we\\nsaw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the\\ntheater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor.\\nI turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie\\nI have ever seen in my entire life!\"\\nThere\\'s really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of\\nthis movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing\\nin life...... \"HOPE\".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold,\\nfunny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same\\ntime.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the\\ngreatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie\\nhistory!  How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting.\\nI should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well,\\nand the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan.\\nThe only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will\\nnever see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I\\'ve seen many\\nmovies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I\\nwalk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it\\nwith and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn\\'t nearly as good as\\n\\'you know what\\'!\"  There have been many movies over the past few years that\\nthought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of\\nall time\", but they\\'ve all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\".\\nSo, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store\\nimmediately.  You\\'re guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section.\\nAnd if it isn\\'t in that section, then you should tell the employees there\\nthat there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this\\nmovie, go see it again.  If you haven\\'t bought your own copy yet, buy one.\\nIn fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an\\nemergency. :o)\\nSo, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI\\'m trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you\\nshould consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five\\nbucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You\\'ll wind up\\ngoing back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies\\nthat are truly timeless. And it\\'s entertaining and moving, no matter\\nhow many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you\\'ll\\ndiscover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you\\'ll\\nidentify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a\\ncharacter, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope,\\nyou\\'ll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of\\novercoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in\\nways that you can\\'t find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course,\\nsome can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in\\nhumanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or\\ntimes. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships\\nthat prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it\\nto you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether\\nShawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home,\\nbecause it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward.\\nNominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single\\nOscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the\\ncorruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the\\ncharacter of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics\\ncouldn\\'t get past the title. The public followed suit, initially\\ndismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It\\'s a\\nWonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away\\non the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell.\\nBut the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed\\ntrue. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of\\nall time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the\\nfilm\\'s title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a\\nprison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people.\\nShawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single\\nspecial effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to\\nthe bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The\\nstory, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the\\ntown of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played\\ntheir roles perfectly.

       " u'\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It\\nis an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and\\nShawshank Redemption.

Andy finds it tough going\\nbut finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis\\n\"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden\\nfinds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker.\\nHowever, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things\\nfor all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film\\nback in 94, with a title that didn\\'t give much inkling to anyone about\\nwhat it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it,\\nShawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come\\nAcademy Award time the film received several nominations, and although\\nit won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home\\nentertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film\\nfinally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost\\nmythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that\\nhas delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors.\\nOne thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank\\nfence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will\\nnever go away.It\\'s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the\\nfilm into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent\\nsentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two\\nchief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But\\nwhen characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it\\nstrikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that\\'s dealing in hope,\\nfriendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that\\nacts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of\\nthe soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No\\nchance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during\\nincarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of\\nRobbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it\\'s the\\neasiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren\\'t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled\\nspring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great\\nas the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist\\nCapt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is\\nimpressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there\\'s Roger Deakins\\' lush\\ncinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison\\noffering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours).\\nThe music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie\\ntoo. Thomas Newman\\'s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly\\nwith Andy\\'s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack\\nranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di\\nFigaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it\\'s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every\\nviewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement -\\nhappiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most\\nhardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank\\noffers hope - not just for characters in a movie, but for a better life\\nand a better world for all of us. 10/10\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nAt the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible\\nperformance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get\\nthings, the \"only\" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by\\nthe Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn\\'t win. (Tom Hanks won for\\nForrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly\\nunderplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the\\nlifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the\\nwarmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan\\nFreeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated\\nrecognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle\\nfor some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story,\\nbanker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his\\nwife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he\\nlends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It\\nis as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this\\nis the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with\\nhis work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic\\nRiver (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the\\nBible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden\\nSamuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want\\nto tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians\\nactually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is\\nrevealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent,\\npredatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated\\nR). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten\\ncontents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words \"His\\njudgment cometh and that right soon.\" The irony of these words as they\\napply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is\\njust perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you.\\nAs most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King\\nentitled \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\" Rita Hayworth\\nfigures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that\\nhe pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film\\nGilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black\\nand white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita\\nHayworth appears. If you haven\\'t seen her, check out that old movie.\\nShe really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next\\nappears on Andy\\'s wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It\\'s\\nthe famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her\\nshapely legs. Following her on Andy\\'s wall (and, by the way, these\\npinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million\\nYears B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show\\nus graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont\\'s direction is full of similar devices that clearly and\\nnaturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out\\nafter fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can\\'t cope with\\nlife on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red\\'s\\nperiodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is\\nsummarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb:\\nthere\\'s not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference\\nbetween the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the\\nwarden, the guards, the \"sisters,\" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn,\\nand perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might\\nbe realistic, and perhaps the \"redemption\" is a bit too miraculous in\\nhow beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with\\na true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and\\nthat is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship\\nand the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and\\nunfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The\\nGodfather) at the IMDb. Don\\'t miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut\\nto the Chaise Lounge or I Can\\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it\\nat Amazon!)\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\n**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write\\ncomments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that\\ngush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched.\\nMost have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone\\nis struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film\\nis *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual\\nexperience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one\\nof the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while\\nwatching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to\\nexplain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it\\nso deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't\\nwant\\nto be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic\\nwand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once\\nand\\nfor all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state,\\nwhile they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching\\nthe bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist.\\nThey're\\nnot destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's\\nnot\\nthat no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to.\\nThey're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale,\\nmagic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini.\\nHowever this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the\\ngovernor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script,\\nthe direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's\\nnot only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever\\nleaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would\\never happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and\\nthat\\nsecurity is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The\\nmetaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a\\nrather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those\\ndon't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow\\nsufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely\\ndon't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy\\nliving.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the\\nworld\\noutside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent\\nfishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this\\nfar.\\nThey'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say\\n'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently\\nthink of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit\\nfrom your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging\\ngroceries\\nat the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and\\ntell\\nyou everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content\\nto mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite\\ndifferent to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out.\\nIt's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from\\nfinding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that\\nmuch and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To\\nthose fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest\\nof\\nus are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't\\nrealistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated.\\nHowever if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives\\nsaved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in\\nfront at number one.\\n\",\n",

When I try to read comments with 1/10\\nstar, I can\\'t find comment with good reasons that could make me\\nrealize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then\\nthis means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people\\nare giving 1 star is that they don\\'t like ratio \"9,2\", they want to do\\nmore effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry\\nfor my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is\\nbig cow with no knowledge...\\n',\n",

This inspiring story\\nis interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting\\nand chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it\\ntouches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with\\na sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was\\nthe first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption\\nis even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean,\\nnor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times,\\nhorrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all.\\nRedemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily\\nredemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is\\nredemption for the way you have lived your life.

       " u'\\n\\nIn recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1\\nwhile THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception\\nwas early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple\\nof months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll\\nprobably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think\\nSHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives\\nand finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives\\nmaggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s\\nrevealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is\\ninnocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during\\nany part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe\\nthat`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates\\nthere are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s\\nabout half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the\\nwarder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and\\na white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the\\nperformances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the\\nmovie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism )\\nbut both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this\\nmovie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the\\nstars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been\\nwritten as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in\\nthinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last\\ndecade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of\\nplaying someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness\\nthe scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with\\nthe darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork\\nof Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for\\nfresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out\\ninto the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s\\nscoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good\\nmovie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by\\nIMDB voters       \\n',\n",

       " u'\\nWhen I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies\\nof all time, I thought \"Yea, I could understand that\". I don\\'t\\nnecessarily agree that it\\'s absolutely the best, but it is so good that\\nit makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings\\nwould rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at\\nShawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to\\nhave hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It\\'s funny, because I don\\'t really think that any one particular thing\\nstands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing\\nreally noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but\\nnone of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great,\\nthe shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is\\nshot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a\\nSears catalogue and I\\'d pay to hear it, his narration breathes life\\ninto every scene that it\\'s spoken over. The real beauty of this film is\\nit\\'s story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it\\'s\\nthe way that each character contributes symbiotically to the\\ndevelopment of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King\\'s novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" was\\nthe short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves\\nas evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true\\nliterary genius. Sure, he doesn\\'t use as many fifty cent words as\\nhistories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story?\\nKing always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that\\nyou can\\'t help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no\\ndifferent. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as\\ngood as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a\\nmasterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It\\'s one of\\nthose journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be\\nalive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece,\\n10/10.\\n',\n",

I remembered crying a few times,\\nbeing astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up\\nsitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime\\nbeauty of Shawshank.

The\\nsimple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly\\nthan this.Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was\\nnominated, but it\\'s all about struggling against unfairness, time\\'s\\nproved its monumental magnitude.Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150\\nminutes.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nI was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all\\npossible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it,\\nthough, it made more sense--this is a \"Rocky\"-type feel-good movie that\\ndoesn\\'t really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to\\nbelieve about human nature. Don\\'t get me wrong--it\\'s a fine film (I gave it\\na solid 7 out of 10), it\\'s just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_\\nand _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script\\nand characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who\\nisn\\'t a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a\\nHollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt,\\nbigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a\\nbrutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict\\nwho knows all the ropes and can\\'t live on the outside, and a convict who is\\nmurdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before?\\nOnly in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There\\'s really\\nnothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from\\nStephen King, who doesn\\'t really do well with complex characters (a problem\\nI noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which\\nthis movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either\\n_The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some\\nchance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think,\\ngo with the late great Stanley Kubrick\\'s _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn\\'t stop thinking about the warden: doesn\\'t he have a family? How did\\nthey feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the\\nprison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than\\nsimply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I\\'m not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I\\ndo an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product\\nwith nothing special to commend it. \\n',\n",

The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!Why? This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine\\nand Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case,\\nthey are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional\\nthan real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much\\nharder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and\\nstaging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as\\nplain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the\\nappeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are\\nthe same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No\\nelement has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the\\nscore.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register\\nthis as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without\\npretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and\\nthis has the appearance of what they need at just the right\\ntime.Is a film great because it merely fulfills?

       " u\"\\nWhen I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on\\na week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the\\nevening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was\\nat a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I\\nhad heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half\\nreluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be\\nblown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was\\ninstantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin\\nwith. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and\\nintellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film\\nremains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well\\ndeserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament\\nas to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a\\nfilm can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There\\nare two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if\\nyou haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you\\nanything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it\\nfor you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the\\nfilm; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from\\nbeginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good.\\nWhat i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further\\nexpress by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank\\nRedemption on IMDb !\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nMost of the people here is the best movie in the world to join me.\\nWatching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great\\nstories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous.\\nThere's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music\\nthat review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you\\nlose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so\\nexhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really\\ndeserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that\\nthe magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I\\nhate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I\\nbelieve wholeheartedly sites. Definitely my best movie 10/10.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nA good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so\\nmuch more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It\\'s not even\\nthe greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it\\'s not even the best movie\\nreleased in 1994! It\\'s predictable and borrows heavily from decades of\\nprison movie clich\\xe9s. It\\'s also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest\\nadmirers would have you believe. Still, it\\'s an entertaining movie.\\nNice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight\\nwith a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline\\nridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly\\n\"stares-off-into-the-distance\" moments. He\\'s so far beneath Freeman as\\nan actor it\\'s sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on\\nthe positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is\\neasily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as\\nsuch the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nWell I guess I\\'m a little late to the party as far as writing down a\\nreview for this picture. I\\'ve seen it a couple of times, but that was\\nbefore I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first\\ndiscovered this site a few years ago, \"The Godfather\" was in the Number\\n#1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and\\nsecond, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That\\npuzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I\\'ve come away\\nfrom the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend\\nto be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my\\npersonal Top Ten list includes titles like \"On The Waterfront\", \"To\\nKill a Mockingbird\" and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest\". I may have\\nto reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don\\'t mind\\ndoing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it\\'s pretty clich\\xe9 to\\nstate it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the\\ndirecting and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even\\nwhen it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen\\'s release and new\\nprisoner Tommy\\'s introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every\\nnuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize\\nAndy\\'s quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks\\nfeeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he\\nreceives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison\\nyard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The\\nstory transcends one man\\'s confinement for a crime he didn\\'t commit,\\nand focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his\\ncontrol. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds\\nof conditions in 1967\\'s \"Cool Hand Luke\", but his method was self\\ndestructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to\\nkeep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to\\ndo so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan\\nFreeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an\\ninspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him\\nfriend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a\\nman can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered\\nby thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who\\nstarted out believing that \\'hope can drive a man insane\\'.I really can\\'t recommend this picture highly enough, both for it\\'s\\nmasterful story telling and it\\'s technical execution. The actors, even\\nthose portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for\\ntheir roles. They deliver a seamless performance that\\'s virtually\\nunmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right\\nnotes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nTo tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in\\nfact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am\\nmore used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat\\naction, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so\\nclosely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to\\ndrive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the\\nharmonica used just before Red's finding of the letter close to the\\nend). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is\\na beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect,\\nMorgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the\\ntale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be.\\nHighly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age-\\n!judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I can't say it\\ndeserved its nO.1 position, i can't say any movie does, but if any\\nmovie should, this one might as well be it. *********\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nIt's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the\\nshelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout\\nbad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan.\\nThis film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as\\nthe second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by\\nStephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it\\nblew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others\\nwho've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me.\\nI will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected\\ntwists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan\\nFreeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even\\nthough I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the\\nsame can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the\\nbest movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very\\nentertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nAt first, before starting the movie, I thought \"Sounds like a typical\\nprison\\nriot and break-out kind of movie\". At the beginning of the movie, my\\nthoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately\\nreminded me of the movie \"The Last Castle\" from 2001), housing people of\\nall\\nsorts, having it\\'s guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical\\ninmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all\\nclaim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved\\nwrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for\\nmurder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life\\nin prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank\\nemployee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit\\nwithin the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius\\nspreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming\\nto\\nhim for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict\\nsurface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie).\\nHe carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly,\\nthis is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a\\nsecret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute,\\nsomething could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman,\\nboth great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good\\nwork\\non the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was\\nalmost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It\\'s worth every minute\\nwatching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and\\nhumor.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a\\nperson in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and\\ncarries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the\\nmovie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to\\ngo out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay\\nhome. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV\\njust by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At\\nfirst I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was\\nscreaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions\\nand so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe\\nthat a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about\\nmy life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great\\nstory of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The\\nShawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite -\\ngives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to\\nfreedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes\\nthe movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond\\nperfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or\\njust bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal\\nshrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never\\nimagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000\\nyears!\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nAs an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I\\nbelieve....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book\\nwe use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the\\nimagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined\\nthe book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank\\nRedemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the\\nfirst time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been\\ndefeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy\\nabout reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will\\nbe the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is\\nbest.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in\\nthe book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and\\nplay the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..\"I didn\\'t\\nunderstand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell\\nU..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt\\nfree...\"The scene just fill my heart with Andy\\'s yearn for freedom...I\\nwas kinda shocked when I didn\\'t find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and\\nstarts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a\\nfellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as\\n\"Dumb-Ass\". Andy says....\"its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like\\nthe book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the\\ncategory it falls is Fiction\" Then Red says..\"Why don\\'t we put it on\\nEducational category?\"(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook\\nas \"Educational\" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my\\nfavorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This\\nwas also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch\\nit....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on\\nthis movie..I would also like to say..\"Shawshank Redemption is the best\\nmovie I have ever seen in my life\".Thanx to all.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThis is it, I have always been so careful on not getting carried away\\nwhile watching great films and calling it the best. I am talking about\\nthe league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly\\nand 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I\\nnever believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can\\nanything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's\\ngot to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough.But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very\\nfirst time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years\\nago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review\\nbefore I wrote my final judgment of this film. This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not\\neven directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true\\nlegends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their\\namazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work\\non cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them. This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every\\ndepartment of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class\\nand intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1\\nfilm status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power\\nof this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is\\nthe film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and\\nfriendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great,\\nbut I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling.\\nOf having found the best film, being a huge film lover. 10/10 - the\\nonly time I ever did or would do this on IMDb or elsewhere.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I\\nam not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it\\nhas been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was\\nand am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope\\nand friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\\nKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\\nwatched them.I didn\\'t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\\nand I don\\'t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\\nas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\\npatrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\\nout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the\\ntime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\\nexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\\nthings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\\nsaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\\nit gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\\neach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\\nI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it\\'s technical merits - I don\\'t\\nreally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\\nor this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the\\nbest technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made,\\nbut not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It\\ntakes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThere are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and\\ncontinued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing.\\nI can happily say that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has stuck to me since\\nI finished watching it for the first time, and instantly rocketed up my\\nTop 10 Films list. Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily\\npicked out - not so in \"Shawshank\", at least not to me. The hefty run\\ntime doesn\\'t put me off because the story and characters are just so\\nwell rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. \"Shawshank\" is one of those films that I would love to experience for\\nthe first time all over again. The thrill of emotions and the highs and\\nlows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else. In my opinion, \"Forrest Gump\" was not as deserving of the Best Picture\\nOscar as this. The timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless\\nplace will likely continue to capture generations of people for years\\nto come.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nBy far the best movie ever...No Doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see, It is easily\\nthe best movie of my life-time so far.Morgan Free is a legend and Rest of the Crew did a marvellous job as\\nwell. Well written / narrated and directed movie of all times.10 out 10.It has been on number one ranking on IMDb and most of the other movie\\nrating websites forever now.The best past of the movie is narrated voice by Morgan Freeman.The character Andy Dufrain is a very well composed and the Warden\\ncharacter has lot of punch into it.Escape from prison was the best it can ever get.Marvellous piece of Art.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nThe reason I am commenting on this film is that I saw that it is #2 in the\\nIMDB top 250 films of all time. Why? It is a good movie, for sure, but there\\nare so many movies that are far superior. Does it really deserve to be ABOVE\\n\"Citizen Kane\"?The Shawshank Redemption is a great story, with fantastic performances by\\nTim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, but it is also a conventional Hollywood\\nmovie and just doesn\\'t venture into very deep waters.Stephen King creates great stories that hold the reader\\'s interest throughout\\nand are always exciting, whatever the genre. Yet he doesn\\'t really make any\\nvery interesting insights into humanity. His characters are either good or\\nevil; there is no in-between for him. That is not to say that his \"good\"\\ncharacters cannot commit crimes or make mistakes, but the \"evil\" characters\\nseem to have no motivation beyond just being, well, basically evil! For\\nexample, Clancy Brown\\'s prison guard and \\nBob Gunton\\'s warden are rather one-dimensional characters. Why do they\\nexist? To make the protagonist\\'s life a living hell. For no other\\nreason.****SPOILERS BEGIN**** While Tim Robbin\\'s prison escape makes you go\\n\"woohoo\" and jump up and down in your chair, it\\'s just not a very feasible\\nplot development. I mean, come on, the guy is there for 20 years and NOBODY\\nnotices that he has dug a four foot hole through his wall? I don\\'t usually\\nhave a problem with surrealism in films, but this is not a surreal film. It\\nis otherwise realistic, so the escape scene just didn\\'t sit right with me.\\n****SPOILERS END****Every scene is accompanied with trite music, so that we know when to be\\nhappy, when to be concerned, when to get teary-eyed. The cinematography is\\ntechnically fine, but there\\'s nothing new in that department. The villains\\nare completely one dimensional characters with nearly no motivation except\\nfor their own sadism, and the film leaves no room for you to draw your own\\nconclusions. Like in most Hollywood films, it is expected that the audience\\nis basically stupid so we have to have it spelled out for us in the end. The\\nmovie goes on about ten minutes too long. I gave this movie an eight out of\\nten, because I love a good story and Tim Robbins is excellent as always, but\\nit is not really the most original film of all time.There are several prison films which I would rate superior to this one.\\nAmong them, \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\", \"Papillon\", and \"Cool Hand Luke\".\\nSee these first before you give this movie a ten out of\\nten.\\n',\n",

Jim Sheridan\\'s \"In the Name of the Father\" springs\\nimmediately to mind.

What\\'s even more heartening is that it\\'s\\nalso true.Like I said, I\\'m not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can\\nremember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent,\\nbut then what\\'s new?), the direction is perfect because it\\'s so\\nunobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just\\nthink it\\'s nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe\\nmy viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge\\nsuccess on video release?I gave it an 8.

Before, films were\\neither plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or\\nhappy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed,\\nrespected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or\\ntwo but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full\\nrange of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters\\nwas even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this\\nwas a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so\\neloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies.

It fully\\ndescribes every small experience of a person serving a long prison\\nsentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay\\nis ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a\\nsecond-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the\\nshow by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy\\nbanker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a\\ncouple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a\\nweapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his\\nfreedom, but impossible to take away his hope.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nDespair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner\\nfreedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in\\nlife make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us\\nricher; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better.\\nAlthough we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may\\ntruly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the\\nmajority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and\\nso concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK\\nREDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any\\nother adaptation of Stephen King\\'s stories onto screen, unlike most\\nproductions of the world cinema. Why? I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I\\nam going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why\\nit is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way,\\nrefers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my\\nemotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the\\nbanker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and\\nsentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really\\nreign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy\\na new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by \"Red\" (Morgan\\nFreeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even\\nin the worst circumstances, within the \"hell on earth\" they can\\nmaintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert\\'s words who nicely described the\\ncharacter of Andy: he says that \"Andy turns out to be a surprise to\\neveryone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir\\nof determination and strength that nothing seems to break him.\" Indeed,\\nsalvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of\\nTommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks\\nHatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most\\nunforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the\\nstory of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of\\ndespair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers.\\nHere, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are\\ndirected towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his\\nperception of the events, his - the prisoner\\'s. Swear words take on\\npower to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is\\nimportant to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to\\nthe fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or\\nharmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know\\nwhat world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations\\nand expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual\\nexperience. With Thomas Newman\\'s terrific music score consisting of\\ndark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective\\nthrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes\\nthe prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip\\n\"The Letter Duet\" scene when the excerpt of Mozart\\'s \"The Marriage of\\nFigaro\" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being\\nawestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of\\nmagnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the\\npowerful line: \"Music makes you free!\" The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is\\nexecuted in an extraordinary way. There are no clich\\xe9s which is a great\\nmerit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that\\ntrap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of\\nRed, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan\\nFreeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of\\npatience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights.\\nIronically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer\\ninside than any \"corrupted decency.\" Tim Robbins also does a terrific\\njob as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a\\ntrue villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in\\nmemory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger\\nEbert: \"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and\\nharmony...\" I would even add that it is the film about true life where\\npeople are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There,\\nwithin the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave\\naccording to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that\\nsurrounds us seems to yell: \"Salvation lies within blind discipline and\\nfundamental Bible!\" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful\\nredemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he\\nbrought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he\\nsucceed?\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI felt a sudden need to create an account on the web. Why? I do not\\nknow. Having never written any movie review, I sometime wonder why I\\nfelt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so. But then I ask\\nmyself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of\\nyears ago. I had looked up the evening's TV program and I stumbled\\nacross the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the\\nfilm's summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it\\nmove me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film\\ncontained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The\\nladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the\\nfilm is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next\\nmany years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something\\nmore to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well\\ntold, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating\\nthe movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching.\\nBecause really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie,\\nwhich takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are\\ntold through storytelling.Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to\\nfantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does\\na hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out\\nslowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film,\\nwhere the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the\\nShawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say\\nthat.I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is\\nsimply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the\\nShawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have\\never seen. My advice is: Buy the film and watch it - you will not be\\ndisappointed.I hope...\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThree words: Oh. My. God.How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and\\nunbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot.

       " u'\\ni watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know\\nwhat.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don\\'t know why but the\\nmovie\\'s end, couldn\\'t stop myself..andy\\'s portrayal by tim robbins and red\\'s by morgan freeman was\\nabsolutely great..i like and love andy\\'s philosophy that \"hope is a good thing..\" .. and\\ni have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was\\nlike.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn\\'t it want to end.. i am\\nnot a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out\\nthere in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their\\ninnocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got\\nsomething in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was\\nabsolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it\\nwith full heart.. i have just finished it..but i\\'m sure i m gonna watch\\nthis very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of\\ntime..\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nIf you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film,\\nthen it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its\\nmain character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience\\nwith a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It\\ndelicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim\\nRobbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life,\\nprojecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories\\nand no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in\\neither style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches\\n- it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just\\nthat. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or\\nstudied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat.\\nI therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the\\n#2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time\\nfavourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you\\nfor tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because\\nemotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls\\nprey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which\\nis devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic\\nfriendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by\\nMorgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThis film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes\\neverything which builds a great story, and that is all films really\\nare, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in\\nan industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and\\nemploying world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy\\noption, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never\\nbe remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves\\ninto people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it.\\nYou are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when\\nAndy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in\\none of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus,\\nMorgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with\\nsuch talent?It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which\\nreally strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in\\nthe face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where\\nrelationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people\\ninvolved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that\\ncharacters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for\\nonce, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very\\nstrong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road\\nof madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed\\nso powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending.\\nPersonally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite\\ncritical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on.\\nShawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story\\nturning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more\\nof the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am\\nnormally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look\\ncool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural,\\nand therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed\\ntotally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet\\nthrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed\\nbrilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the\\nspectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and\\nyou hate the warden and his captain with a passion.I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen,\\nyou jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be\\nbroken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you\\ncan watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and\\nbringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins\\ngives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which\\nMorgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for\\nMillion Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone\\nto watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the\\nentire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is\\nany drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning\\nit's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent\\nthis, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on\\nmy personal top 10.\\n\",\n",

The thing\\nthat is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of\\ncourse] didn't use extreme clich\\xe9s - there's no black and white painting,\\njust numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their\\nroles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high\\nranking.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nAll is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the\\nprincipals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption,\\nvengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i\\'ve ever seen. Tim\\nRobbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand\\nof feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really \"Red\". Gunton,\\nSadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of\\npeace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie\\ndeserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No\\naction, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a\\nBIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think\\nand I realize the incredible power that the cinema\\'s industry have. In a\\ndifferent way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the\\nsame impact.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nSince I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King\\'s\\n short films, one of them \"The Woman In The Room\", directed by Frank\\n Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become\\n one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with\\n another King\\'s story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade \\n(90\\'s), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr.

       " u\"\\nAlong with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead\\noriginal writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood\\nPowerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an\\nAmerican Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely\\nmade it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a\\nfilm to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a\\nsplash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18\\nyears ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including\\nEW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late\\n'94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope\\nthis film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where\\nat the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my\\nbasement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since).\\nDarabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films.\\nHe made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big\\nMac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only\\nregret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two\\nyears later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The\\nEnglish Patient won on a weak year.)\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nI will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first\\ntime. I was 16-years-old and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a\\nschool night.

It\\'s\\nlike nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the\\nemotional roller coaster that \\'The Shawshank Redemption\\' takes you on.First question I usually ask people when discussing films is, \"So have\\nyou seen Shawshank?\". No matter what their reply is I am happy with the\\noutcome because if they say no, then they are yet to see the greatest\\nmovie of all time. If they say yes, I have something to talk to them\\nabout for the next 27 minutes.You probably still won\\'t believe me when I tell you that this is the\\ngreatest film you will ever see. It\\'s that good that I actually told\\none of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed. Then\\nshe will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to\\nit. Now when I see a movie all I think is, I\\'ve already seen the best.Now actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece (not\\nthat any summary of the plot could ever do it justice). So all I will\\nsay is this, I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review. Do\\nyourself a favour and don\\'t even bother to finish reading this. Just go\\nand watch it.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nI finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an\\nexcellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest\\nthroughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving\\nending.The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for\\nthe murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out\\nthat he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a\\npowerful message that it doesn\\'t matter whether you are innocent or not\\ninside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a\\nsadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the\\nintellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay\\nalive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.Andy befriends \"Red,\" a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in\\nanother great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival\\nwithin Shawshank\\'s hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master\\nability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials\\nto get funds to set up a \"basic skills\" learning facility within the\\nprison\\'s library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the\\nfunding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the\\nhead librarian, known as \"Brooks,\" who delivers many amazing scenes in\\nthe movie.What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters,\\nespecially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise\\nabove the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are\\nsome disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of\\nprison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or\\npunished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at\\nall. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison\\nauthorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above\\nthis abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They\\nlearn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other\\ninmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. \"you can get\\nbusy living, or you can get busy dying.\" Another interesting experience\\nis how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to\\nsurvive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An\\nunderlining message is that whether you \"get busy living or dying\" you\\nbecome so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the\\noutside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and\\nmentally \"free\" are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance\\nand the ultimate in determination.As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that\\nwould put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I\\nthink that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as\\ngood if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn\\nMovie, \"Bad Boys\" for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a\\njuvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad\\nofficer in \"Shawshank,\" is just as good as a prison bully in \"Bad\\nBoys.\") Another great movie is \"Midnight Express\" which is (although\\nloosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in\\nTurkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is\\nanother amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical\\nscore and some chilling moments.I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than \"Midnight\\nExpress\" or \"Bad Boys.\" This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am\\nonly putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison\\nsurvival pictures that don\\'t get the same credit that this movie does.\\nCall this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for\\n\"Midnight Express\" or \"Bad Boys.\" All three films have the same\\nemotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is \"An\\nInnocent Man,\" which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is\\nconsidered only above average.The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of\\nsimilarities to other similar prison pictures, I can\\'t classify it as\\ngreat for all time\\n',\n",
       " u'Add another review',\n",
       " u'\\nTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely\\none of Stephen King\\'s more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly\\nwith a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the\\nconsequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long\\nprison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great\\ndignity) describes himself as \"the only guilty man in Shawshank.\" The\\nhardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the\\nviewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape. Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a\\nbrutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is\\nquietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he\\ntakes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there\\'s a wider\\nselection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for\\nwriting. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a\\nstretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still,\\nthey make an impact because of all that happens before.It\\'s a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might\\nhave happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of\\nthe tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and\\ndirector Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nTo call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no\\njustice\\nat all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn't\\nbelieve how good it was.  I expected a film that would pass the time by,\\nand\\nI got a film that I could identify with.  If you are feeling sad, and\\nyou\\nthink the world's a rubbish place, this fills you with hope.  I love the\\nopening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the\\nmusic\\nkicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.  The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films\\nthe\\nwords are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes\\nyou\\nwant to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that\\nmake\\nyou feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. The film and book reciprocated the message 'Hope Springs Eternal', which\\nmeans so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be\\nbetter, things might change for us, and hope never dies. I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it\\naway, because it's in your head.  If I have a rubbish day at work, then\\nit's\\ntrue that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene\\nwhere\\nhe plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of\\npiece of\\nscript, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full\\npotential\\nto give more impact to the words and the characters.  This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the\\nDirector wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of\\nfilm\\nthat made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the\\nmovie\\nwas over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about,\\nit\\ntakes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived\\nthat\\nexperience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines\\ndelivered,\\nwill always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is\\nthe\\ndilemma we face in everyday live).  This will live in my memories\\nforever,\\nnot like the sorry cash-ins of movies.  This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is, but words just seem\\nso\\nlittle to explain the brilliance of this film.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nShawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film\\nI have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of\\nhappiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone\\nand everyone.  \\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nNow, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this,\\nin my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway\\nyou can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the\\npinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile\\nimagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going\\nthrough the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (\"Red\") are a\\nbalance of the human spirit.

       " u'\\nBefore watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really\\ndidn\\'t think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned\\nthe #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn\\'t be better than The Godfather for\\nexample. A movie that was \"cool\" to like, if you will. I could imagine\\nfashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses\\nof Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the\\nmost, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical\\nmessages. You get the idea.I\\'m sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made\\nhas been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the\\nreason I\\'m posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn\\'t\\nonly a hardcore movie freak\\'s wet dream. While it\\'s brilliantly\\nwritten, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the\\nfantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don\\'t have to\\nbe an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many\\ndifferent groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the\\nsame time. The \"weaknesses\" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail\\nmovie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of\\na movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible\\nwith the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption\\nis loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for\\nanything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing,\\nand my first 10/10, I think I\\'ll let it slide this time.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nFrom the director of 1990\\'s \"Buried Alive\" comes perhaps the strongest\\ndrama of 1994. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is emotionally fulfilling in\\nevery way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont\\'s\\nscreenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King\\'s short\\nnovella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\", is at once soul\\nstirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank\\nDarabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely\\nunpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of\\nloving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the\\nright elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire\\nsupport cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted\\ndouble murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and\\ndetermination superbly. He\\'s a man who not only strongly believes he\\nhas a future, but that it\\'s a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world\\nweary \"Red\", the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise\\n(\"whatever you want\") to other inmates. He is gradually transformed,\\nand always surprised, by Andy\\'s optimism, geniality and brilliance. In\\nsupport of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an\\nover all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the\\nforeboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman\\'s music is awe\\ninspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a long movie, though it would seem that\\nto shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial\\nscenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont\\'s brilliant script and\\nastute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support\\nproduction. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry,\\nlisten and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We\\'re\\nleft in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is\\nunexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph\\nof the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not\\nexpected, and that\\'s what makes this story so great. \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\" comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written\\ncharacters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully\\nemotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure\\nthat you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played\\ncharacters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton)\\nand the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy\\nBrown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema\"The Shawshank Redemption\" was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank\\nDarabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far\\nthe best prison film I\\'ve ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and\\nMorgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend\\nstrong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas\\nNewman\\'s score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its\\naudience you can\\'t go past \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre\\n',\n",

But compared to Papillon? There are so many\\nsimilarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came\\nout of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared\\nwith Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally\\nmuch more touching, and when even Freeman\\'s great performance doesn\\'t\\nmatch Hoffman\\'s, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen\\n- in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn\\'t\\ngive him the chance that Steve had.Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the \"original\" too, it\\'s not\\nold-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge\\ndifferential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young\\npeople have never seen Papillon.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nIn this review I\\'m not going to give a plot synopsis of this film\\nbecause I\\'m sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I\\nwill express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let\\nit.The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the\\ngreatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned\\nlife-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his\\nown against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore\\'s\\nportrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the\\nstory, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy\\nBrown\\'s commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head\\nprison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.Frank Darabont\\'s restrained direction of the delicate story is critical\\nfor the film to not become sentimental or clich\\xe9d, and his beautiful\\nadaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a\\nreal breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that\\nspecial effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a\\n17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next\\nperson, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that\\nthere was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn\\'t exist, when they\\nmade movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance\\nto be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort\\nto special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a\\nnon-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age,\\nMr. Darabont.SPOILER ALERT! As with all truly great films, \\'The Shawshank Redemption\\' is full of\\nscenes that have become entrenched in the public\\'s collective\\nconsciousness. There\\'s the scene where Andy plays the opera record over\\nthe loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley\\nbashing \"Fat @$$\" to death for crying during his first night in prison\\n(a very powerful scene), Red giving his \"Rehabilitated?\" speech to the\\nboard of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and\\nof course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration\\ncalls \"500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can\\'t even imagine,\", the\\nscene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the \\'90s.END OF SPOILERS! I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its\\nplace in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever\\ngender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language\\nyou speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save\\nit. Movies like \\'The Shawshank Redemption\\' only come along once every\\ndecade, if that. Unforgettable.10/10.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has\\n every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant\\n script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad\\n performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately\\n uplifting story.Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from\\n first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's\\n (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime.\\n This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever\\n captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in\\n the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red\\n (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to\\n develop.This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue\\n spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie\\n are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen\\n performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no\\n other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman\\n also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while\\n playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a\\n quiet dignity for his character. The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never\\n over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the\\n prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks,\\n who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con\\n who's sad journey the film details.There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit\\n first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is\\n a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!,\\n he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be\\n made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but\\n perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red\\n sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing\\n short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely\\n not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.***** out of *****\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\nDeliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\" alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of\\nlife in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to\\nreally be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn\\'t take up\\nmuch of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the\\ndifficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods\\nof incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on\\nhis usual outstanding performance as \"Red\" - the wise old con through whose\\neyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker\\nwrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to\\nthe nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with\\nBob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy\\'s\\nfinancial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks,\\nimprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole\\nand who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in\\nthe only home he ever knew - prison. It\\'s an interesting twist - experience\\nalso by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a\\nprison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an\\ninstitution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though,\\nthere are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are\\nsome spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of\\nMaine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn\\'t seem to me like\\nsomething that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a\\nletter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six\\nyears, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the\\nimprovements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that\\nafter a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy\\'s escape\\nalso bothered me. It was too \"easy\" - even though it took twenty years. And\\nhow did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through\\nthat dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his\\nescape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story\\nwas also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a bit over-rated\\nhere at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is\\nstill a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of\\nthe survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I\\ngive it a 7/10.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nTim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who\\nis sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan\\nFreeman\\'s Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen\\nKing\\'s short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" (in the\\nfilm version, it\\'s really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the\\nultimate twist). On the surface, it\\'s another prison-genre picture with\\nthe usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few\\nhomosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn\\'t want his parole.\\nHowever, the film\\'s emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well\\nserved by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out\\namazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure\\nfantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it\\nneeds, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but\\nengrossing and satisfying, \"Shawshank\" was not a big hit at the\\nbox-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from\\n****\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it\\'s quite\\nsimply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of\\nKing\\'s short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and\\nvoted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in\\nthis film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the\\nend, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there\\'s really\\nnothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It\\'s about hope... and\\nthe director won\\'t let us forget it, so it\\'s repeated until the\\naudience mumbles it in our sleep. It\\'s like this short, one-note story\\nwas written, and the author just didn\\'t want to end it... so he kept\\nwriting... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the\\ndoor and wrestle the pen from him yelling \"for the love of all that is\\nholy, stop writing!\" And I thank that faceless man for doing that,\\nbecause it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes\\nlong, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on\\nand on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but\\nwith excellent acting, mind you). There\\'s nothing good about this film\\nexcept for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can\\'t really\\nthink of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems\\nfrom my hatred of King\\'s writing. I suppose it is possible for someone\\nwho is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to\\nfans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you\\'re\\nnot a fan of any of these people, I doubt you\\'d find this enjoyable.\\n5/10\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThere is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and\\nit tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste,\\nbut its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was\\nnominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in\\nlove with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several\\nhundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its\\na great one.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is very enjoyable, features excellent performances,\\nand has won a fanatical following among a lot of people.  I just saw it.  I\\nliked it.  But as for becoming fanatically enthusiastic about it, all I can\\nsay is, folks, let\\'s not get carried away...The story not only is incredibly *simple* (good man unjustly convicted for\\nhorrible crime maintains hope in horrible confinement), but is also\\nincredibly *simplistic* (the Warden and his men are evil goons, the convicts\\nare good).  Complexity is something completely exiled from this\\nstory.The director, Frank Durabont, offers nothing new in his aesthetic choices --\\nSHAWSHANK is stock Hollywood filmmaking, especially of the Spielbergian\\nvariety ala THE COLOR PURPLE and AMISTAD.  The soundtrack is overpowering in\\nits efforts to imbue the story with \"heartwrenching emotion.\"  The\\ncinematography is fine in a sort-of standard-issue, \"seen it before\"\\nway.Which begs the question:  Is there anything truly *exceptional* about THE\\nSHAWSHANK REDEMPTION?  Heck yeah -- Morgan Freeman proves, once again, that\\nhe is not only a wonderful actor but also one of the most endearing,\\npowerful presences in cinema.  Tim Robbins is fine, along with all of the\\nconvicts.But overall, I didn\\'t mistake THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for anything\\nparticularly new, remarkable, exciting -- in other words, as anything worthy\\nof fanatical enthusiasm.  It\\'s a fine Hollywood film that looks, smells,\\nsounds and feels like your typical fine Hollywood film.  But nothing\\nmore.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest\\nrated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I\\nwould never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont,\\nthis prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope,\\nfriendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the\\nmonotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the\\ntwo main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have\\nheard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the\\nfaith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more\\nyou learn from it Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say\\nthis movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and\\ngreatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want in a\\nmovie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond\\nredemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a\\nmasterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad\\nabout not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late\\nnineties.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis movie is a total piece of manipulation. It does have a few\\nredeeming features though - Morgan Freeman's narration all through is\\npure art!!! This guy acts with his mouth!!!

C'mon!!!\\nCertainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those\\ntimes I would say is fairly realistic.The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring\\ntrue. There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized\\nand do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good\\nsupport network in place.This is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly\\nfor them and doesn't require any thinking. Personally I like a bit more\\ndepth and reality.I don't want to put people off seeing it - it should be watched once.\\nBut for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nSpoilers Ahead:What a powerful piece of work!! It it was all done without kung fu,\\nexplosions, spitting and eternal fighting like movies twenty years\\nlater. If only young filmmakers would imitate this masterpiece. Like\\nALIEN, the acting carries the film. This film\\'s acting is beyond\\ncomparison; it has a great supporting cast featuring the always great\\nWilliam Sadler. People just will never understand that you must have\\ncharacter development with great villains like the warden from hell and\\nClancy Brown\\'s captain of the guard; who is a walking refutation of\\nAristotle\\'s idiocy that no one does evil for pleasure they only do it\\nbecause they mistakenly believe it to be good. It starts so slowly\\nbuilding to a great denouement. The character development and the\\nacting are what you want to watch this for; this is from a bygone era\\nbefore we all went deaf trying to watch a film.The script is well written but without Freeman and Robbins the film\\nwould have failed. This is the film that made Morgan Freeman the Icon\\nthat he is today. Film buffs like me saw his potential in his earlier\\nbit parts in BRUBAKER and STREET SMART. His performance is the greatest\\nof his life; it dwarfs the overrated DRIVING MISS DAISY. This role is\\nfar more complex; he emotes with his eyes and body language with such\\nease. This is acting on the level of Marlon Brando. Again, the\\nvillains, the warden and the captain, will make you hate them so\\nintensely you will love their just rewards at the end of the picture.\\nBrooks, the librarian, such a little sub story within the picture\\nshows, without being maudlin, the tragic fate of old prisoners who have\\nforgotten how to function on their own. He utters one of my favorite\\nphilosophical axioms from the movie,\"Get busy living or get busy\\ndying.\"This is why the film works James Whitmore a staple from Film Noir was\\nalways a powerful actor. Bob Gunton, no matter how bad the movie, i.e.\\nBROKEN ARROW, is a villain you love to hate. Clancy Brown surpasses all\\nhis other roles as the sadistic captain who enjoys hurting people. The\\nlength of the film serves the script; the friendship between Andy and\\nRed is the core of the picture. It grows very slowly as each get to\\nknow the other. Parents should be advised that like all of Darabount\\'s\\nfilms it pulls no punches with violent, graphic realism. The cruelty of\\nthe warden blended with his religion is of course a requisite for all\\nfilms made after 1990. Nothing those NEW AGE bring the light Nazis\\ndemand more than all villains must be Christian religious fanatics. We\\nknow all these positive energy sending fascists are all paragons of\\nvirtue. I do not hold it against the movie; it is a sign of the intolerant\\ntolerance crusaders and their hilarious hypocrisy. You will adore this\\nmovie. I watch it over and over. If you are religious like me, just\\nremember they have to attack a morality because they have none and are\\nfilled with guilt. If it did not bother them so much they would not\\nattack it so mercilessly; I think somebody is feeling badly about all\\nthe evil they are doing; what do you think?\\n',\n",

The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great\\nperformance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob\\nGunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison\\nguard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore\\'s portrayal of an\\nelderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every\\nactor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

       " u'\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception\\nand ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins\\' and Morgan Freeman\\'s best\\nwork as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes\\ncontradictory nature of a convict\\'s existence, where I am torn\\nemotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and\\nsorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in\\nall the actors\\' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel\\nguards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their\\nrespective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a\\nloudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There\\nare exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the\\nprison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse,\\nthere are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I\\ncheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the\\ncharacters in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" both prisoners and guards\\n(those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many\\nshades of gray.One of the most touching moments in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a\\nscene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his\\nadult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world\\nthat is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And\\nhis fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier\\ncreatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of\\na thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope\\nof ever escaping.\"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,\" from \"The\\nShawshank Redemption.\"As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic\\nbackgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of\\nthe human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so\\nhard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way\\nmy family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a\\nlittle girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main character\\'s spirit there shines upon all\\nthose who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope\\neternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being\\neach time I view this incredible story about the invincible human\\nspirit.\\n',\n",

Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\"\\nRedding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red\\nprocures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone\\nchess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth,\\nfollowed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch.\\nAndy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the\\n\"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).\\nIn 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy\\nBrown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs\\nhim about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the\\nSisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs\\nbeing sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel\\nNorton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison\\nlibrary to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a\\npretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice\\nand expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from\\nnearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state\\ngovernment for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks\\nis freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50\\nyears in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation\\nthat includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an\\nexcerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving\\nsolitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds\\nonto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red\\ndismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for\\npublic works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and\\nreceiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias\\n\"Randall Stephens\". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is\\nincarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy\\'s and Red\\'s circle of friends,\\nand Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.)\\nexaminations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy\\'s case, Tommy\\nreveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an\\nidentical murder, suggesting Andy\\'s innocence. Andy approaches Norton\\nwith this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places\\nAndy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the\\nguise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but\\nNorton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection\\nand preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary\\nconfinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a\\nMexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being\\nunrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a\\nspecific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at\\nroll call, upon finding Andy\\'s cell empty, an irate Norton throws one\\nof Andy\\'s rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The\\nrock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug\\nwith his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night,\\nAndy escaped through the tunnel and the prison\\'s sewage pipe with\\nNorton\\'s ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While\\nguards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall\\nStephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money.\\nFinally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders\\nat Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and\\ntake Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.\\nAfter serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to\\nlife outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to\\nAndy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter\\nasking him to come to Zihuatanejo.

       " u\"\\nAnd I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown\\naway.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an\\nincredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely\\nand utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main\\ncharacters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes\\nthat, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used\\nbecause it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes\\nthat hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better\\ntomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be\\nheld to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of\\nthe greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is\\nmerely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly\\ngreat, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it\\nrepeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events\\nthat occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over\\nand over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I\\nsimply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that\\nmakes this film incredible.

       " u'\\nDeservedly ranked at the top of IMDb\\'s all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is \"Red,\" a wise observer of\\npeople and an entrepreneur inmate who\\'s made \"connections\" so he can\\nget contraband to other inmates for a price; he\\'s under a life sentence\\nfor murder. Tim Robbins is \"Andy,\" a smart banker and accounting whiz\\nwho was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover\\n(which he--like most other inmates, say they\\'re not guilty of). And Bob\\nGunton is \"Warden Norton\" who, when we first meet him, is touting the\\nvirtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately,\\nI\\'ve had no first hand experience, \"Shawshank\" certainly gives the feel\\nof authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state\\npenitentiary in the late 1940s. \"Red,\" in talking his thoughts out loud\\nto himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story\\nunfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong\\npersonal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And\\nin Andy\\'s work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden\\nas morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral\\ncharacter--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert\\'s first review (of his two) of this movie, he said:\\n\"....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\\nworth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a\\nreason....\" Most viewers will agree.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. The\\nOscar\\'s biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that\\nShawshank deserved. Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also\\nan amazing movie, but it just can\\'t compare to Shawshank. Morgan\\nFreeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a\\nperformance that I feel is greatly underrated, and also deserved an\\nOscar nomination. The films art direction adds to the story\\'s beauty,\\nand gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. I remember seeing The\\nShawshank Redemption on sale for $5 at Wal-Mart and thinking \"I heard\\nthis is good\" so I bought it. Little did I know the film was worth more\\nthan gold. I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple\\nweeks, not overly anticipating watching it, but finally decided to\\nwatch it when I was bored. I am a gigantic movie buff, and have so many\\nmovies it\\'s almost pathetic, but The Shawshank Redemption changed my\\nentire view of film. Now, every time I watch a movie I can\\'t help but\\nthink \"It can\\'t beat Shawshank.\" Some people say that this movie is\\noverrated, but that\\'s wrong. Shawshank is an actual work of art, to be\\ncompared with works of DaVinci and Picasso. When people say this movie\\nmakes them cry, they don\\'t mean to say it\\'s so sad, but that they\\ndidn\\'t know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen.\\nI believe that if everybody see\\'s only one movie during their life, it\\nshould be this one. See it now. After that, IMDb will seem like a whole\\nnew website because every film will seem like a different movie. It is,\\nby the very definition of the word magnificent.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThe story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\\nvictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\\nthe murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy\\nfinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\\nof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\\nmind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\\nresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\\nall from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds\\ngainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of\\nShawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines\\nof prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to\\ntake a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to\\nRed and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\\nprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\\nscreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\\noutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\\nequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\\nthis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\\nhe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\\nThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\\na focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\\nup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the\\nnovella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great\\ndeal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He\\nemploys the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood\\ncomposer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's\\nneeds by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper\\nsoftly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman\\nlends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the\\nunique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did\\nnot go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.\\nWhile unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on\\nyour concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume\\ndesigners, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood\\nartists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation\\nto work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some\\nof the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While\\nboth Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red,\\nrespectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of\\namazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most\\nnoticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays\\nthe elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an\\nunmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the\\nShawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a\\ntrue dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\\nmotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\\nanything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nIf there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course,\\nfor practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten,\\nbecause of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like\\nalso to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my\\nopinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk\\nvery little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to\\nwrite and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the\\naverage piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism\\ndesignating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it\\ncomes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise,\\nfor fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an\\neternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clich\\xe9d,\\nwhen it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is\\nbeautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of\\ntenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight\\nfor justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will\\nhappen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and\\nagain be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the\\npersistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for\\njoy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in\\nall senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I\\ncan discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank\\nRedemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly\\nacted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and\\nflourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our\\nattention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking\\nlike he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there\\nisn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some\\nof the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful\\ncinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you\\nmust agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There\\nare, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly\\nattracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and\\nobjective value, cinema does not get much better than this.\\n\",\n",

Tt especially\\ncaught my eyes with the montage of shots in which the character Brooks\\n(James Whitmore) takes his own life, the non-diagetic sound adding to\\nthe other element of suspense of the scene and the devastation of the\\ntragic loss of the character in which we have been following through\\nthe course of the film. The cinematography throughout the film was\\nbasic and what i would term as standard, seen before basic film\\ncamera-work. If this was better it would have highly improved the films\\noverall watch. throughout the course of the film we see Andy Dufresne\\n(Tim Robbins) supposedly framed for the murder of his wife and her\\nlover. We see how he progresses through the twenty years he spends at\\nShawshank Prison. We see Robbins act brilliantly as the role of a\\nnimble, lost and lonely convict turn into a reliant of the Head Warden.\\nThis all becomes of the fact that in Dufresne's previous life he was a\\ncity banker, which is where he gets the nickname of 'wife murdering\\nbanker' around the dim lit prison. Morgan Freeman also shows that he is\\none of the worlds leading role- modelling actors as he pulls of another\\nsupreme unique perform. The way he acts during the duration of the film\\nis entirely versatile proving the Freeman is an exceptional actor and\\nperforms single handed an outstanding performance.The plot consists of many twists and turns with both leading characters\\ngetting into difficult situation and how they overcome them, or not.The final half an hour of the film is soul touching and what i would\\nterm as an emotional rollacoaster with a large twist at the end. As\\nsuspense builds it creates a sensational climax tagging the film a must\\nwatch!I generally don't watch films more than once or twice but this is a\\ndifferent story. It still amazes me to this day and still gets me\\nmoving every time, it also influences me a lot.If you haven't watched this i highly recommend you do so!Joe Ferrari\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nIm not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this\\nfilm is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of\\nthe other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is\\nwithout any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is\\ntremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper\\nmeaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is\\nabout the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is\\nyour greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his\\ngreat escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is\\nalways meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds\\nwhen Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends\\nwith, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the\\noutside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds\\nthat he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later\\nin the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is\\nfinally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same\\nsituation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself\\ndidn\\'t commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he\\ndoes have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend\\nagain and to \"give him a handshake\". And as the movie comes to a\\nmarvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I\\nwill continue to keep watching it again and again and again.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated\\nmovie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders\\nto our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely\\nconvicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies\\nin the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he\\ninfluences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman\\nin the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever\\ncome across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King,\\nis equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The\\ndialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring.\\nThe background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red\\nrespectively.Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as\\npossible. Can't miss a movie like this....\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I\\nreally can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the\\nwriting, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with\\nstrength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think\\nabout even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an\\nevil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge\\nto insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of\\ntime goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really\\nputs you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those\\nbars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure\\nhorror of it all.4 stars out of 4\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI never saw this film on the silver screen. I didn\\'t want to see it on\\nvideo either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my\\nemphatic reply. \"I\\'m not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con\\ndoing tax returns for the guards\". Fortunately for me, this video store\\nowner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not\\nknowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot\\nof movie trash out there. Because they didn\\'t need to - all they needed\\nto do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best\\nmarketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many\\ntimes. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But\\nit is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it,\\nquite rightly, as IMDb\\'s top ranked film.I don\\'t care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination\\ncoupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case)\\nis top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted\\nwrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to\\nsurvive. Red (Freeman), the man who can \"get things\" befriends him. The\\nstory then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality\\nintertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most\\nhazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man\\nwhose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost\\nanything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard\\ncompletes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing\\nwhether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the\\nending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant\\ncheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that\\nRobbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions\\nwhere 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in\\nthe early 90\\'s, then it\\'s time for me to adopt my friendly video store\\nowners guise and say \"Watch this - its the best film ever made\".\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nOut of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The\\nShawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum\\nbrunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it\\ndebuted in theatres together with one of cinema\\'s greatest watershed\\nevents; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated\\nfor seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by\\nthe critics\\' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics &\\nviewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with\\nremarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank\\nRedemption enjoys a position that\\'s arguably even higher than the two\\nclassics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at\\nits time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as\\none of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful\\nbanker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit\\nlover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in\\nprison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life\\nslowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff,\\nincluding that of \"Red\" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The\\nremainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two\\ndecades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but\\nprofoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that\\'ll manage\\nto connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also\\nmarks Darabont\\'s directional debut and he couldn\\'t have asked for a\\nbetter start. All this film has is men in either prison or police\\nuniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet\\nit never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside\\nprison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film\\nis set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while\\nmoments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the\\ngradual progression of Andy\\'s life, his friendship with Red, and his\\ndetermination to not give in to the four walls containing him is\\neffectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman\\'s score beautifully blends with\\nthe film\\'s tone & characters\\' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling\\nperformance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the\\ncrime he didn\\'t commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan\\nFreeman is even better as Red, Andy\\'s friend who is also serving a life\\nsentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods\\ninto the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does\\nan even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but\\nthe character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people &\\nwhy many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even\\nafter two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep\\nreturning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason\\nis that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its\\nstory of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a\\njailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment\\nin the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family,\\nsociety etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on\\nthe outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be\\nfree even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in\\nfreedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold\\nyou prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some\\nhope, there is nothing we can\\'t survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n\\neverything, but then if there\\'s ever been a motion picture that has\\nearned this sort of right, it\\'s The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly\\nrecommended.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI haven\\'t seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no\\nproblems giving this one top score.Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the\\nelements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect\\n\"form\". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when\\nhe put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan\\nFreeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this\\nmovie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of\\nthe supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly\\nbelievable (and bad guys don\\'t come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It\\nmust have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and\\nend. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects\\nwrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said,\\n\"This is just right!\" Buy this one for your home collection because\\nyou\\'ll definitely want to see it again.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nI always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse\\nhimself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And\\nfor generation after generation there\\'s only one film that I will\\nalways give praise for, finally giving a masterpiece that successfully\\ndelivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of\\nhuman spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this\\ninspiring film. It\\'s powerful in every way, that for me it brought back\\nthe real definition of an excellent film which is \"a great story with\\ngreat characters\".Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was\\nconvicted for murdering his wife and her third party who\\'s a pro\\ngolfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the\\nnotorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence.\\nWhile counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy.\\nMeeting \"the sisters \" was one of his hardships he needed to go\\nthorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which\\nmade his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met\\nEllis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things\\nand run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a\\nhammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the\\nfirst one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety,\\nthe two became prison buds as the days became months and the months\\nbecame years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their\\nstay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at\\ntimes they contradicted at each other\\'s opinion for Andy had always\\nbeen the \"hopeful dreamer\" and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in\\nspite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several\\npolice and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy\\nthrough his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things\\nwaiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed\\nthat HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole\\nwill never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an\\nalmost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the\\nend of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you\\nmoved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an\\nabundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.It\\'s the best film I\\'ve seen and it will always be carved to the bank\\nof triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI totally adored the concept of hope in this film.

Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be\\nthe greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the\\nset. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of\\ncharacters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of\\nShawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's\\ntoo good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought\\ntears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all\\nthanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the\\nfirst place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And\\nkudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nOne of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day\\nclassic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and\\nfind solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a\\nStephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this\\nfilm than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim\\nRobbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan\\nFreeman as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close\\nfriend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the\\nWarden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed\\nfeelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who\\nis sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film\\nis easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I\\ndefinitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy\\nAwards including (Best Picture, Best Actor \\x96 Morgan Freeman, Best\\nAdapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original\\nScore, and Best Sound) but didn\\'t win any due to tough competition from\\nthe film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have\\nbeen nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the\\nperformance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!\\n',\n",

Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if\\nyou haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at\\nleast once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of\\nendurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning\\nscore that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it\\ncould make grown men cry.

Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce\\nmoviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest\\nshot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real\\nchance that they simply will not \"get\" this film, and that\\'s too bad -- they\\nare missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter\\nhow pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank\\nsucceeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the\\nedgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.

       " u'\\n***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film\\nInstitute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100\\nYears...100 Movies list. On this, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" was listed\\nat #72. I find it insulting it was ranked so low.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the\\nnovella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King. There\\nhave been many adaptations of King\\'s works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery,\\nThe Green Mile, etc.) but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" outshines them\\nall. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who don\\'t know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a\\nbanker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully\\nconvicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and\\nsentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He\\nbecomes close friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman),\\nthe film\\'s narrator who has a reputation for being able to \"get things\"\\nfrom the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the\\nbest of friends as the years go by, during which time Andy\\'s financial\\nknowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt\\nWarden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering\\noperation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time\\nin prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and\\nmaintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at\\nthe conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace\\nthrough his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency\\nthat, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an\\nexcellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank\\nDarabont\\'s direction and Roger Deakins\\' cinematography. While the\\ncharacters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless\\ntrapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the\\ndark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins\\' lead\\nperformance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is\\ndelivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions\\nare perfect in capturing the character\\'s calm, laconic yet hopeful\\ndemeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and\\ndeserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His\\nnarration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience.\\nParticularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof\\nof why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and\\ndeserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics\\nand viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabont\\'s\\nskill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman\\'s skills as\\nactors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of\\nfilmmaking and is up there with \"The Godfather\", \"Citizen Kane\",\\n\"Casablanca\" and \"Gone with the Wind.\" One of the greatest achievements\\nin cinema in recent times.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI\\'d never heard of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" when I tuned in to it\\nabout 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around\\n1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the\\nmusical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with\\nAlta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I\\nfound out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered\\nthis film as a \"sleeper,\" on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been\\n\"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Heat.\" I didn\\'t see \"Forrest Gump\" until around\\n2000 or so, and didn\\'t care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I\\'ve gone back\\nthrough), I suppose \"Shawshank\" will fall below some other films. There\\nseems to be a a trend toward making \"Hey, it\\'s not all that!\" (That is,\\nit\\'s not all that good, it\\'s lousy, it\\'s overrated, etc.)Whatever, it\\'s a great film. And when I happened to see it late one\\nnight on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how\\ngreat it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on\\nIMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for \"The Big Lebowski,\" which for a while I thought I was the\\nonly fan of. Now it\\'s a subject of festivals and midnight watchings,\\nsort of like \"Rocky Horror\" once was. I saw \"Rocky Horror\" in 1976 at\\nthe World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was\\nnot very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after\\nanother, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score.\\nUnforgettable.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nI will never forget the first time I watched \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and\\nmale-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a\\nsolid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and\\nthe TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that\\nwe had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our\\nhearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how\\ngreat that film \"with the poster\" was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each\\nviewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I\\nguess if it doesn\\'t justify, at least it explains why this movie that\\ndidn\\'t do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD\\nbefore it would ultimately dethrone \"The Godfather\" from the first\\nplace on IMDb Top 250. And it\\'s only justice if \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in\\nthe glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with\\nan appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people\\nand did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently\\nbut determinedly. This is the strength of \"The Shawshank Redemption\", its ability to tell\\na story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the\\nso-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the\\nsmallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in\\na prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are\\nregulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of\\nthis routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of\\n\\'having a life\\'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank,\\nfrom the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we\\'re literally submerged by\\nthe solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel.\\nThese characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the\\nWarden Samuel Norton, who\\'s like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched\\nfrom \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest\". And the comparison with\\nForman\\'s film isn\\'t fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its\\noccupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point\\nthat the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only\\nvaluable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own\\nreason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with\\nthe books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who\\ncould get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the\\nlaconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by\\nTim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the\\nmurder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is\\ninnocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have\\nconditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary\\nfor us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let\\nhis character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves\\nthat he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same\\nfeeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend.\\nMorgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free\\nspirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of\\nabstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and \\'busy\\'\\nin the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that\\ntakes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was\\nallowed to put his banker\\'s casket again and feels that prison didn\\'t\\ndeprive him from his \\'social quality\\'. Shawshank is not slow but more a\\npatience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts\\nour intelligence. And the film\\'s motto, on which relies its philosophical core is \"Get\\nbusy living or get busy dying\". Now, two things occur to me while\\nwriting these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks\\nwho was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was\\ninstitutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall\\nthat scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while\\noutside, it\\'s all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn\\'t\\nlive outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The\\nsecond thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was\\nreading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn\\'t help but make a\\nconnection with the beautiful message of Darabont\\'s film, an invitation\\nto dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your\\nlife and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion\\nillustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music\\non the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves\\nand having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of\\nhuman spirit, this understanding of the value of life is \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\"In the same vein than \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest\", \"Shawshank\" is\\na constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best,\\nfor whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to\\nfeel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that\\nthings can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs :\\n\"Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you\\nknow you can lose.\" This is the true intelligence of life, what makes\\nit worth living.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King\\'s\\nnovel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of\\ncourage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.\\n',\n",

Then I one day decided to watch the\\nShawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie\\ninstantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter\\nhow dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the\\nend of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning\\nbright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all\\naround you, till the time life may finally turn around for you.

The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on\\nhope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous\\neloquency.

       " u'\\nAn outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners.\\nMany social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a\\nwell-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have\\ntied with the winner, the equally good \"Forrest Gump.\"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as\\nprisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all\\nabout. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and\\nultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions,\\nMr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a\\nprisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole\\nfollowing a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been\\nincarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment\\ntraining before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant\\nultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This\\nis a memorable viewing experience for audiences.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many\\nreasons. The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting\\njob, and that is saying something.

The\\nsupporting actors are wonderful as well. Enough about the acting which\\nwas second to none but the story was so compelling. The audience feels\\nsympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed, in\\nthe end its just a feel good story. I cannot express this enough, GO\\nWATCH THE MOVIE NOW!

This is the kind of film that make you think of how\\nmany inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears\\nabout.

       " u'\\nThis film is, love it or hate it, flawless. I find myself unable to\\npick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or\\ninconsistent. The Director, Frank Darabont, despite his\\nmuch-less-than-impressive filmography successfully animates every scene\\nand character in living detail. Whats more is the life and detail he\\nbrought to his screenplay.Originally published under Richard Bachman, Stephen King\\'s\\nonce-pseudonym, \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" is one of\\nthe most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately\\nuninspired fiction author in history. The book makes no attempt to\\nbuild or define characters, background, or story progression. It\\nbasically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the\\nwriter clumsily tries to convey the point of the book: as hopeless as a\\nman\\'s situation is, his dreams and fantasies live on. After King\\'s\\ncatharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and\\napathetically caps it off several pages later.Frank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves\\nmuch more credit for crafting 95% of this movie purely from his own\\nimagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from\\ncomplete tripe. Credit where credit\\'s due, Stephen King doesn\\'t even\\ndeserve royalties.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nWhere to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful,\\nhaunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is\\nabsolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats\\nof Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful\\nsoundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years\\nafter your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker\\nwho is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is\\nconsequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison.\\nAndy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and\\nruns an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things\\nfrom outside prison.Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal\\nfinancial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely\\n'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for\\nAndy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his\\nfriendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of\\nShawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected\\nand tragic events.Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change\\npeople, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons,\\nboth comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much\\nmore intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and\\nhe works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the\\nguards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he\\nbegins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the\\nguards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the\\nfore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the\\ninnocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a\\nserious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's\\ndecisions become more and more unpredictable.Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults\\nat all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting\\npresence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance\\nhe has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But,\\nwhat makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script\\nand the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most\\nbeautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many\\nof the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly\\nreflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find\\nthemselves in.This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the\\npersonalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may\\nsuddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally\\nexpected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is\\nendlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nAfter watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the\\nfirst movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had\\neverything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so\\nwell from the original short story, which again was very good. How\\nanyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There\\nis nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the\\ncasting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not\\noverlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King.\\nWithout having writers like him, we would never have any movies to\\nmatch up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting\\nfor another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i\\nam doubtful if this will ever happen.\\n',\n",

When\\nthe film ends it takes you 10 seconds to get back to reality again -\\nits just that compellingBest personal Film of all time and best film on IMDb and rightly so\\nSpectacular Film !\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThis film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first\\n10 minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to\\nwatch it. This story is about a respectable banker (Andy Duframe) who\\nis sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he\\ndid not commit. Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn\\nthat the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very\\nunusual being very quite and polite around the prison. At the\\nspectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer\\nsuch an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film\\nevery made. A must watch film!!! 10/10\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nIt was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it.\\nAdapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of\\nsuccess), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven\\nOscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as\\nlife began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The\\nShawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of\\nthe most revered and cherished films of all time. Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King\\'s short\\nstory \\'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\' brings the tale to\\nlife in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion.\\nDarabont\\'s script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking\\ndirectly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication\\novercoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to\\ntackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank\\'s without\\ncoming across as painfully clich\\xe9d, but Darabont\\'s airtight script,\\nchock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough\\nto raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which\\nthe emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins\\'\\nsweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman\\'s truly beautiful\\nand inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank\\nprison itself, the film\\'s consistent quality on all fronts is truly\\nstunning. It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an\\ninferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont\\'s incredibly gifted\\nand memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful\\nstory and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings\\nunconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a\\npassionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and\\nhopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding,\\nRobbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making\\nthe role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The\\ninspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate \\'Red\\' resulted not\\nonly in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious\\nvoices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting\\ncharacter, with Freeman building a career of playing similar \\'wise\\nmentor figures\\' off his performance. The supporting cast being\\ncomprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of\\ntheir characters, leading the audience to see them as their character\\nand not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective\\nas the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his\\nreedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could\\ncapture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but\\neffective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows\\nis a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is\\ncharming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment,\\naddressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is\\nsentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic.\\nIn many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic\\ncinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences\\nhappy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and\\nhonestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly\\nestablishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of\\nflooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a\\nsimple \"prison drama\", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank\\nRedemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits\\nthen euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red\\nmay declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it\\'s Darabont\\'s fearless\\ntackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free. -10/10\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThe Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene.\\nAlthough Andy's innocence was obvious from the beginning, you just\\nthink how he's going to get out of it.For me, the power and depth in this movie was it's ability to make\\nprison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also\\nwhen they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the\\noutside and wanted to go back in. I'm not sure why this affected me so\\nmuch but i think it's just the fact that one mistake forced these\\npeople to live in a certain way where they don't want so much freedom\\nand they're used to being workers with no rewards. They just couldn't\\nadapt to the outside world. As if it were a different planet or\\nsomething.Although the men are supposed to be 'cold hearted killers', they seem\\nso nice and are so easy to sympathise with. I know it sounds lame to\\nfeel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and\\nacting, had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent... except\\nfor some obviously. Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i\\njust wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the\\nmovie.If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first\\ntime they've seen it...i think it's a sign that if the person reading\\nthis still hasn't...they should. The Shawshank Redemption most\\ndefinitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top #250.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nOut of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the\\nincredible prison story called \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" It is the\\nstory of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been\\nfalsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the\\nnotorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses\\nevery prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further\\nsubjected to additional punishment by the \"Sisters\" who enjoy torturing\\nwhat they call \\'fresh fish.\\' Still Andy tries to survive each day of\\nhis sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking\\ncraft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of\\nhis personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to\\ntake advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over\\nthe years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis \"Red\" Redding\\nwho is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden\\nSamuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes\\' financial ability, he\\nimmediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many\\nfinancial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and\\npatience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden\\nintends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to.\\nBe he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional\\ncharacters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy,\\nMark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior\\nperformance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for\\nthe enjoyment of every audience. ****\\n',\n",

It's true what they say about this having an impact on\\npeople's lives as it did me. From the moment it starts and you start to\\nhear the narration of Morgan Freeman you know there is something\\nspecial to this film.The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be\\nour salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly\\nwhat brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice it's so\\npowerful, in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration.There are two best scenes for me most powerful is Reds 3rd parole\\nhearing it sums up total acceptance of what he's done and he can be\\nopen to them about how he truly feels without a care or worry in the\\nworld. The second is when Red finds the Box under the Oak Tree and the\\nwhole story seems to come together at that point. The way time\\nprogresses is an essential aspect in this film and that's another\\nexcellent example you see of Andy and the Warden almost becoming\\npartners in crime and they develop this close bond. Prison Drama? No\\nthat description doesn't give this film justice it's a pure masterpiece\\nand if you haven't seen it I would advise buy a copy now you won't be\\ndisappointed. Even after 50 or so viewings I still get a lump in\\nthroat.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is the best movie robbed of acclaim. I don't care what anyone says\\nabout Forest Gump. This movie is better in almost every category except\\nmusic and maybe tied for movie of the year.Tim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks. I always have a\\nproblem with the simpleton character getting acting nods, as with the\\nwhite trash and ghetto thug characters. I think most of us can all do\\nthe Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel\\n(Simpsons).I can't quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a\\nmovie, but this movie blows me away on almost every level. The quite\\npassion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the\\nFreeman sidekick character.This movie was of course a short story made into a movie (S King i\\nthink) and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the\\nbest movie of 1994, and probably one of the top 3 movies of all time.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nI knew about this movie for a long time.Heck, prison movies, don't turn me on so I have very negative\\nimpression, hence not watching it. I watched it today (Oct 2005) as it\\nwas on TV, and I thought, it's got good rating, so I'll watch it, least\\nthis way I won't be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with.Well, any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an\\nemotional minefield, has to be respected. This movie has my utmost\\nrespect.This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and\\nseeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a\\nreally amazing film.This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So\\ntechnically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots,\\nmusic and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be\\none very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing\\nreviews.The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can\\nbe flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious\\nlevels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.You can't as its so simple.We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better\\nfuture. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live.\\nNot doing so, there is no meaning to life.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires,\\nthat is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is\\nabout, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?Are you Positive?Do you have hopes?Do you have dreams?Do you have goals?Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of\\nmaking someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal\\ngain?If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are\\nnot alive, you have no meaning to your life.In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did,\\nbut when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what\\nreally is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect\\nmechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end\\nit now.So my advise to you?Don't Watch this film. If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you\\nare a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable\\nlife, and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck, it'll take you\\nseveral lifetimes probably to get it.So, remember DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, you don't deserve it.\\n\",\n",

But it was a big surprise to see one of the\\nbest films ever made. ( I have seen it 6 more times since then\\n)It is a story of COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, TRUE FRIENDSHIP, HOPE AND\\nREDEMPTION.IT'S A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES, A MEMORABLE ONE.\\nEVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT.

       " u\"\\n\\nMy favorite movie ever.  These are words that basically describe how I feel\\n about this movie.  A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie,\\n but this is very entertaining.  Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as\\n Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He\\n arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes\\n best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by\\n Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven).  Soon the warden, played by Bob\\n Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his\\n help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other\\n things.  It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best\\n movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it.  Tim Robbins is great\\n in the lead.  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden.  William Sadler \\n(Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict.  Clancy Brown (Starship\\n Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards. \\n Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of\\n terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts.  A must\\n see. \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nNone of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of\\nStephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real\\nworld of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and\\nthere's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim\\nRobbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife\\ncheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted\\nof putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced\\nto two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob\\nStroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the\\nprison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances\\nand pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and\\nthe rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell\\nblock scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship.\\nIn the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House\\nat the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite\\nprison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption\\ncomes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by\\nFrank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did\\nMorgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a\\nflock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances\\nare that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for\\n50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will\\nbreak your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather\\nlikable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you\\nwith his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James\\nCagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of\\nboys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as\\ncorrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate\\nhoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber\\nof the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way\\nhe can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly\\ncreatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the\\nworld of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if\\nyou see this wonderfully crafted and acted film.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nI have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now, the second time being\\nabout a week ago. After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10\\nrating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings\\nof 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one\\nviewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed\\nnear the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel\\neven more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it. The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new\\nplot points and character developments slowly at first and then more\\nrapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long,\\nbut it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only\\nserves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the\\ncharacters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we\\nalso get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped\\ninside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next,\\nnever feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly\\ndialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey\\nthe brutality of prison life.Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any\\nmovie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen\\nit, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored.\\nBoth times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the\\ncredits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and\\nthe entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both\\ngreat movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction;\\nhowever, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win\\nBest Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion,\\narguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest\\nmovies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan\\nFreeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim\\nRobbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins\\ncarries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I\\nhave ever seen. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It\\ntakes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long\\nafter it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you\\nthink, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have\\nnot seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this\\nis the highest ranked film on IMDb.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest\\nprison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least\\ncompetent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to\\n\"submarine\"-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat,\\ntherefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha).\\nBut also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same\\nsituations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and\\nI rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden,\\nsadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but\\nalso few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his\\ninevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who\\nof course has been convicted in the first place based on false\\naccusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what\\'s so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks\\nworked here as in that other Stephen King\\'s hit-penitentiary-drama \"The\\nGreen Mile\", i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard\\ncharacters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they\\'re\\nwatching at face value and never mind that \"I\\'ve seen this all\\nbefore\"-feel. Or maybe they haven\\'t or just have a lousy memory? Yes I\\nadmit, I\\'m something of a cynic. But I also believe I\\'m able to spot an\\ntruly honest effort when I see one. Probably that\\'s the reason why I\\nconsider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy\\'s 1932 \"I\\'m A Fugitive\\nFrom A Chain Gang\" as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery\\nhere, as I hope you\\'ll agree when you see this true classic.\\n',\n",

Andy being a banker\\nconvicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie\\ntakes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit\\neventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a\\nlong time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere\\nperformances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is\\nfor the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart.

I only wish that I could view\\nthe film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming\\nfeeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own\\nexperience, the last half hour are especially beautiful.

       " u'\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s say this from the word go...Shawshank Redmeption might as well\\nbe called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz.  Lets just see how many shopworn\\nprison movie cliches the picture has:1.)  A corrupt warden\\n2.)  Brutal guards\\n3.)  Homosexual gang attacks (at least not in a shower)\\n4.)  Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery\\n5.)  All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty\\nphrases.\\n6.)  No racial tension, in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan\\nFreeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple\\npicture...after all, it appears all he is there for is to be the witty\\nsidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad\\nwomen.\\n7.)  A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison\\n8.)  Nobody in jail is bad, or even seems like they could be violent, they\\nare all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs.  I guess this\\nmeans\\nwe should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just\\nlike us...a chilling thought.\\n9.)  Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to\\nescape,\\n10.) Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself\\nclean of his past and putting on a new life.I am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared\\nStraight, but come on, this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very\\nunreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say.  The\\nShawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another\\nholier than thou morality play packaged as \"gritty realism\" all because it\\nis based in a prison...ho-hum.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nSorry folks, but can this film really be (one of) the greatest of all time?\\nEntertaining? Yes. Well acted? Err...yes.  'Life affirming'? No way.\\nRealistic? Don't make me laugh.Twenty years or so pass in this film. Does anybody get any older? Apart\\nfrom\\nthe occasional pair of specs, that's it. Not an extra wrinkle to be seen.\\nWhat happened to the make-up department?People get beaten to within an inch of their lives. One death and one\\nwheelchair case, but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear\\nrapidly.The 'baddies' get their just deserts and we're all supposed to shout 'serve\\nthem right' (as we say in England).\\nThe 'goodies' live happily ever after, but we knew that would happen within\\nthe first ten minutes.\\nThe people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a\\ngreat author. Competent and popular...yes. Great...no!!\\nP.S. Who replaced the poster after...?\\nWas that an oak tree? Maybe leaves are a different shape in\\nAmerica.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThe redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. \\nDarabont had no idea he was making anything profound.  And he wasn't.  This\\nis a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for\\nit's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks\\nthat this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or\\nis in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws.  These elements play so\\nlittle role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore\\nthem.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank\\nRedemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them,\\nand then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with\\n`The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results.  I haven't seen `The\\nGreen Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong.  A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I\\nthink is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment\\nat all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind.  Still,\\n`The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great.  It's a very good story very\\nwell told.  Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up\\nwith Stephen King's prose every step of the way ...  Also, Tim Robbins has\\nthe lead role.  (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a\\nfrightening thought.)  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent\\nso well as he can.  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but\\nI don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it\\nworks so well.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nBy far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against\\nat the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible\\nmovie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was\\nalso a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of\\nit. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so.\\nBut to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry.\\nI wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think\\nthe public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that\\ndoesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins\\nand Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden\\nis protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last\\nthing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie\\nhistory.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n'The Shawshank Redemption'... hmm where do I start. 'The Shawshank\\nRedemption' is clearly one of the greatest films ever, I find that it\\nreally can show what it would be like trapped in a tiny little prison,\\neventually you would only think of what's outside the prison instead of\\ninside or you might even become attached to the prison or should I say\\nhome.What the audience really enjoy's about this movie is that you have been\\ndeceived for you believe through out most of the movie that there is\\nnoway out for poor Andy Dufresne and that he is trying to be nice to\\nthe guards for a chance of believable. After that you discover that the\\nwhole film and everything that has happened has all gone towards the\\nescape of Andy Dufresne and the suicide of the dreadful warden. The\\naudience has been gullible enough to believe that Andy was getting used\\nto the prison. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly not just a movie, it is also\\nbeautiful art. Every little piece of the movie was delicately put\\ntogether to create pure yet daunting art.The story is about Andy Dufresne a wealthy intelligent banker who's\\nwife is having an affair with another man. Eventually both the wife and\\nthe other man are killed while having sex, with all evidence pointing\\nto Andy, Andy is sentenced to two life times of prison. In prison Andy\\ndoes a lot of the workers at the prison's (and that include's the\\nwarden) banking. From then of the story is all about Andy in the prison\\nand he idea's of hope and love of music.One of the most beautiful and touching moments in the movie is when\\nAndy locks all the doors in the room that has the microphone and plays\\nopera music of two Italian women singing opera in Italian. Morgen\\nFreeman then say's that he had no idea what the two Italian women were\\nsinging but doesn't want to know, he just like to imagine that the\\nwords were too beautiful to be sung in English.The acting is brilliant and the directing is directed absolutely\\nunbelievably tremendous. I praise both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins\\nfor a very touching movie that I will always remember.In conclusion, 'The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films\\never that I have ever seen, if you do not like it I will also\\nunderstand that you didn't listen closer to the brilliant word that\\nwere able to come out of the actors mouth.Hope is a dangerous thing.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nEmotion, hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film. Quite\\nsimply, no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay,\\ncasting and plot development. No spoilers here - just a comment on a\\nmovie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings.\\nMorgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else\\ncomes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as\\nForrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a\\ngreat picture but this one really deserved the \"cake\". Tim Robbins is\\nAMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could\\nonly hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions\\nwhere the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and\\nflow. If you haven\\'t seen this film, please do yourself the favour and\\nwatch it.

       " u'\\nShawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10.\\nI had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and\\nloved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same\\nstory. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and\\nalmost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say \"OMG, I love this\\nstory!\" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I\\'m\\ntotally freaking insane for at least one more day...But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man\\nconvicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank\\nprison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his\\nfellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at\\nShawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially\\na source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon\\nbefriended by Ellis \\'Red\\' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and\\nquickly becomes one of their own.Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy\\'s life in prison,\\nas narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on\\nto a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both.\\nAndy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his\\nfinancial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things\\nAndy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value,\\nbut you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has\\nhad value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper\\nphilosophical sense.The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It\\nis about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith.\\nHow do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we\\nrecover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our\\nconnections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It\\nis alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one\\nof the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the\\nbest films ever made.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nNot only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen, it also\\n has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen.  The\\n bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the\\n score is the best I've heard\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\n      This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about\\n life, your life!  \\n      Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in\\n a dark atmosphere.\\n',\n",

In fact, there\\'s a lot to like about this movie.\\nBut there was absolutely no reason why this movie needed to go on and on\\nand\\non and on.Excellent acting of course:  Freeman is always right on target and Tim\\nRobbins is very good (although I happen to dislike his political views and\\nthat inhibits my ability to imagine he\\'s anyone else but Robbins up there\\non\\nthe screen).Its a movie that makes one think about the important things in life, and\\nit\\ndoes that without being preachy.However, I don\\'t like the way it uses cliches all the way through, i.e.\\nthe\\nbad warden who is a pseudo-Christian.  Hollywood has shown much hatred\\ntowards Christianity,  and this is only one more movie in a long string\\nwhich tries to make Christians look bad.****spoilers ahead********Also, it is simply not believable that (a) the prison would not have moved\\nAndy in 19 years of prison life, and (b) the sound of his rock scraping\\nwouldn\\'t have been heard and (c) he wouldn\\'t have been seen \"underneath\"\\nthe\\nposter, working away at the wall.I find it hard to believe furthermore, that Andy would go back into the\\ntown\\nwhere he proposed, just to leave money under that rock.  An escaped\\nconvict\\nwould not want to be anywhere near where people may recognize him, if he\\nhad\\nany smarts, which Andy did.But those things alone did not prevent me from enjoying the movie, I just\\ndon\\'t think the movie lived up to its hype, and I would feel no need to\\never\\nwatch it again (and I always watch my favs over and over\\nagain!).\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nOver the years many IMDb users have wondered why \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\" was ranked so high, and many \"wished\" that in time it would\\nsink to a lower, more appropriate slot. Many analyses missed the mark.\\nFollowing is the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will\\nnever sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.This film deals with several \"hot\" buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A\\nhusband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement.\\nA prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a\\nbrilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two\\nfriends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a\\ngood script and good cinematography. What\\'s not to like about this\\nstory?I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new\\nout of it that I either didn\\'t see before, or had not made a mental\\nconnection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from\\nDVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better. This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it\\nreally should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don\\'t\\nknow exactly where \"Shawshank Redemption\" should rank on the all-time\\nlist. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from\\ndifferent centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in\\ncinema. I gave this film a \"10\", and on my list it is in one of the\\nbest movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same\\ntime, I recognize that everyone else has a different opinion. I don\\'t\\nreally see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time.\\nEach film should be appreciated for what it has to offer, no more, and\\nno less.\\n',\n",

CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at\\nyou. I suppose there must be some of you out there\\x85What is quite\\ndifficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema\\ncould have managed to avoid seeing it for the 20+ years since its\\nrelease! In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a\\nserendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the\\nexception that proves the Murphy\\'s Law rule. Just look at the IMDb\\nbreakdown analysis of the vote\\x85 In every area of human activity, there\\nis always that \"2%\"! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters\\nrated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! I invite you to check! In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of\\nlong-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario,\\nperhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is\\nclearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate\\nBlack/White \"BRO-mance\"\\x85 Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman\\'s character,\\n\"Red\", is anything but the \"predestined to an untimely end\"\\nsidekick\\x85The entire film is literally narrated from Red\\'s perspective.\\nIf anything, Red\\'s \"Main-Man\" prison status gives him a bit of a\\ndominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their\\ncharacters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of\\nlifelong best BUDS! I can\\'t help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of\\nmaking SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic\\nmilestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw-\\ndropping, but in a negative sense: Opening Weekend\\x97A starkly paltry\\nPosition #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U.S.! Overall 1994 Box\\nOffice, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster\\nSpot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in! My initial interest was piqued by a theatrical trailer, but I had to go\\nby myself\\x85My wife, who is a rather avid movie goer, said\\x85\"H-m-m-m-m, a\\nprison drama?....What\\'s the Title?\" After hearing it, she responded,\\n\"The SHAW- What? No, Thanks\\x85I PASS!\" Well, needless to say, after a\\nfirst viewing, my awe was complete and unmitigated, so I insisted on\\ndragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife\\nbecame an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in\\nour lifetime top 5 favorites! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an\\ninauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted\\nin my wife not going to see it in 1994! I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot\\nhere! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but\\nZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the\\nmighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year\\nwith 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X\\nSHAWSHANK\\'s! Wonder what the Academy\\'s members take on this would be\\ntoday? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominated\\x85Each one is\\nexquisitely superb! Not a single Golden Statuette\\x85WOW! As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained\\nand totally insulated prison environment, it isn\\'t much of a stretch to\\nimagine an Old-Testament thumping warden anointing himself with almost\\ngod-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist,\\nwhen one thinks of Illegal Immigration, Mexico, or Central America, to\\nthe USA invariably is the route that comes to mind\\x85not the opposite,\\nright!?!?!? Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to\\nmesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have\\nbeen a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so\\nseamlessly\\x85Can\\'t go into any more detail without treading into SPOILER\\nterritory, so you\\'ll just have to figure it out for yourself! SHAWSHANK\\nis truly a film for the ages! 10* STARS*\\x85....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Espa\\xf1ol, are\\nmost welcome!\\n',\n",

Based on a\\nshort story by Stephen King (which is truly extraordinary), the plot\\nfollows a man wrongly convicted for murdering his wife. The rest of the\\nmovie follows his time spent in Shawshank Prison. Written for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, this movie\\nturned out to be a box office flop; ironically, it went on to become\\none of the most rented movies of 1995 (similar to It's A Wonderful\\nLife).

       " u\"\\nThis movie...where to begin. Well it's hard to believe that when I sat down to watch this movie,\\nthat I was expecting a grim depressing movie, about how bad prison life\\ncould be. The main reason I watched it was because I am a Stephen King\\nfan, and I heard this one was the best. So I sat down to watch it, and\\nI was fully prepared to feel depressed, and also sad. And when I\\nfinished watching the movie, how did I feel...there is no way to say it\\nother than: The exact opposite. I felt uplifted, happy, and after\\nwatching the ending, I simply said that this was one of the best movies\\nI'd ever seen. What I liked about it so much is mainly the plot, and the characters.\\nAndy Dusfrene, and Ellis 'Red' Redding are prisoners in the Eastern\\nMaine Penitentiary, known as Shawshank. Andy spends over twenty years\\nin the prison, Red even longer. And when I was watching I could feel\\n(even though it is not shown physically) the years passing. The movie\\nspends the first 3 quarters of the movie at the prison, and you really\\nget to know it, and it's inhabitants, very well. The character you get\\nto know best though is Andy. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself,\\nbut there is so much more to him then that. In the twenty years he\\nspends there he manages to earn the respect of his fellow prisoners\\n(particularly Red), the prison guards, and the cruel warden Samuel\\nNorton. Then one day he mysteriously disappears. Or to be exact, he\\nescapes, the first man to ever escape from that prison. It takes him\\ntwenty years to deceive all the guards, that he is a quiet honest\\nperson, that would never try to escape. During this whole time he was\\nplanning his escape, right from the start when he asked Red if he could\\nfind him (Andy) a rock pick. It took him twenty years to do all\\nthis...hat's devotion if I've ever seen it, and that's why I loved his\\ncharacter. Then there's the last 15-20 minutes of the film which take\\nplace outside the prison. The last 5 minutes though, when Red (who is\\nalso a fairly likable character) decides to reunite with the escaped\\nAndy, it becomes very emotional, and a truly beautiful piece of cinema. So people say this is the best Stephen King adaptation of them all, but\\nI think calling this movie a Stephen King movie, is like calling The\\nLord of the Rings a blockbuster trilogy, it just doesn't quite cut it.In fact I simply must say that this may just be the best movie ever\\nmade. It has an excellent plot, gritty and realistic setting, a sense\\nof hopefulness (despite being a prison movies), extremely likable, and\\nrelatable characters and an ending that can truly touch the heart and\\nsoul of many viewers. It is absolutely 10/10\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThis movie really displays how horrible life in prison was in the\\n1900s.The guards, the warden, the facility itself. It just feels so\\nreal and almost scary for the watcher. I gave this movie a 9/10 because I found that it captured almost\\neverything I find important in a movie. I also just love everything\\nfrom Stephen King and this truly is, his masterpiece.You really get pulled into the story as it goes on and understand the\\nthoughts and feelings of the main character.Brilliant actors, a great director and of course the man to thank it\\nall for, Stephen King.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nStephen King does create wonderful short stories and while I think his\\nbooks are hardly manageable on the silver screen I think his short\\nstories are. Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption is the perfect\\nexample. With a great cast and an intriguing but not overly complex\\nstory this film has everything it needs to be a masterpiece. The actors\\nhave great chemistry together and while I don't appreciate the changes\\nthat were made, I do understand them. The director caught the feeling\\nof the short story and created a believable experience. Some of the\\nscenes are light hearted to an extent were you expect them to be free\\nthe next moment just to tear down this scene and show the degrading\\nbrutality of prison.\\n\",\n",

He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\\ncandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\\nday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners\\nunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\\nprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\\nDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy\\nturns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him\\nis such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing\\nseems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he\\'s in for\\nmurder. He\\'s apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details\\ninvolving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality;\\nall that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who\\nis not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes\\nup in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his\\nterm (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been\\nrehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out\\nof his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that\\nhe has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills\\nhimself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on\\nthe outside.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe review may contain spoilers!! The Shawshank Redemption is a movie\\nthat everyone will surely enjoy. The movie begins with a slow pace and\\nas time passes you begin to love the characters and in the later part\\nof the movie you wish it goes on and on. While watching the film, you\\nexpect a different type of ending(kind of an ordinary one). But at the\\nend you realize that this is not an ordinary movie. The movie contains\\na very good message for all of us. The kind of patience and hope that\\nAndy has is simply brilliant. Morgan has done a good job too(as usual).\\nHe has done his role as \"Red\" with complete dedication. The dialogues\\nand background music help you to get completely involved in the movie.\\nThere are two scenes which leave you with an awe! The first one is when\\nAndy gets out of prison by travelling through the drainage pipes and\\nthen enjoys the rain falling on him. And the second one is at the end\\nwhen Red is released from the prison and Andy waits for him at a beach.\\nMy favorite dialogue is \"Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the\\nbest of things and no good thing ever dies.\"\\n',\n",

Frank Darabont\\ndidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\\nlove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.

       " u'\\nOne of the finest films ever made, this movie is a sheer work of art.\\nIt\\'s a poignant story of hope. That\\'s what makes this film much more\\nthan just a movie. It tells a lesson about life. It\\'s a narrative about\\nfreedom, friendship and patience. The Plot is average, but the\\nstory-telling, acting and cinematography are the reasons that make the\\nmovie, memorable. The director Frank Darabont has been flawless with\\nhis work. The story is about Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbings\\nthrough the eyes of Red (played by Morgan Freeman, in his best role\\never). Andy is wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his\\nwife. The story focuses on Andy\\'s relationship with \"Red\" Redding and\\nhis attempts to escape from Shawshank. Although nothing much happens in\\nthe way of plot for 2hours, in a movie having a playing time of 2hrs\\n22minutes, you would never get bored. I won\\'t give any spoilers, in\\ncase you haven\\'t seen it yet. Just go and watch it. You will not be\\ndisappointed. There is no way, it is highly overrated. Its topmost\\nposition in IMDb ratings is the evidence.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\"All men die, not every man truly lives.\"\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe first time I saw Shawshank, I loved it and didn't want it to end. I\\nremember that desire being surprisingly powerful, despite understanding\\nthat I had enjoyed it as much as I did while watching it. Its power\\nsurprised me because I didn't understand fully how or why I felt the\\nway I did. On subsequent viewings, I prepared myself for the ending,\\nfor THAT feeling, which I began to examine. I would describe it as something on par with the end of a relationship,\\nif not perfectly in scale, then certainly in context. A good\\nrelationship. One that ends too early, but does so because it must,\\nbecause that is just how it is sometimes. I am always struck with a\\ndeep yearning to see more, to know and feel more, but also a comfort.\\nThat even though I didn't get everything I wanted, what I got is a damn\\nsight good enough, and I should be grateful for that. But it aches,\\ntoo. And then you realize that it's over, and you're going to wake up\\ntomorrow, and start living your life again. But now you'll live having\\ngone through this, with this perspective, this story in your memory. It's small, not actually the same experience, but it's close. The same\\nshape and color. No other film, no story, gives me this feeling. And\\njust like in relationships, sometimes I end up watching nothing but\\ndisappointing titles, I have a moment when I ask myself why I do it.\\nThat maybe I'm wasting my time. And then I remember. And then I hope.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nIn my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film ever\\nmade. The acting is on par and the directions is pretty darn close to\\nperfection. The Shawshank redemption is one of those films that is\\ndesigned to make you think, and boy does it do its job. The screenplay is possibly one of the greatest ever scripted. The way\\nit cleverly weaves in and out is extraordinary. Stephen King should be\\nproud that a film like this originated from his book. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect movie. I don't think anyone\\ncould give it lower than a 7. The film will appeal to anyone, if not\\neveryone, and will leave you vey satisfied long after the credits roll.\\n\",\n",

Some movies like 'The Godfather' which I find\\nextremely overrated just wouldn't satisfy me being #1; neither would\\n'The Dark Knight'.Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful story which has been directed,\\nproduced, and acted flawlessly.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To\\nKill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having\\nwatched them.I didn\\'t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies\\nand I don\\'t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day\\nas I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older\\npatrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check\\nout this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the\\ntime, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV\\nexcept things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or\\nthings that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she\\nsaid, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and\\nit gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to\\neach other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies\\nI have ever seen. I do not judge it by it\\'s technical merits - I don\\'t\\nreally care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather\\nor this or that movie is the best movie ever made.

To\\nsimply put, this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time\\nand their journey to redemption.

I brake every single time when watching sequence\\nwhen Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free -\\nit is a powerful film making so say the least.Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays\\nwith you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at\\nrunning time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film\\nmaking universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when\\naction takes place inside the prison and there isn\\'t mainstream action\\nat all. Good things never get old, and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is\\none the fainest examples.\\n',\n",

Fortunately, failure\\nwasn\\'t a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell\\nfast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for\\nfailure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans\\ntoday, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a \\'Shawshank\\' was.\\nOn the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on\\n\"that \\'Rickshaw\\' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film\\'s a nightmare, as\\n\\'prison drama\\' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between\\ntwo best friends doesn\\'t spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie\\nis slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post,\\n\"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance\\nof narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is\\nthese same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a\\ntotal eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and\\nGothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts\\nits shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above\\nevery shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all\\nmemories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope.\\nIt\\'s in music, it\\'s in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here\\'s\\nwhere you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don\\'t forget.\\nForget that there are places in the world that aren\\'t made out of\\nstone. That there\\'s a - there\\'s a - there\\'s something inside that\\'s\\nyours, that they can\\'t touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn\\'t think much\\nof Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o\\' milk with the silver\\nspoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word,\\nand losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two\\nget to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This\\nagain, is one of the film\\'s major strengths. Many movies are about\\nlove, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the\\nonly one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two\\nbest friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship\\ntime and again, when it\\'s a feeling that weighs so much into everyone\\'s\\nday to day lives. Perhaps it\\'s too sentimental to seem conventional,\\nbut Shawshank\\'s core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film\\nis much better for it.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nOne of the greatest movies ever made. Shawshank tells the story of Andy\\nDufresne, a banker convicted of his wives (and her lovers) murder. When\\nAndy comes across inmate Red, the two form a near two decade long\\nrelationship. With Tim Robbins and Morgen Freeman in lead roles,\\nShawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should\\nwatch. Frank Darabont's directing is great and even more so than any of\\nhis previous work. There's really not much wrong with Shawshank. The\\nadaptation from Stephen Kings epic novel is compelling, exciting,\\ndisheartening and inspiring. With great supporting characters, an\\nincredible plot and stunning directing, Shawshank has become one of the\\ngreatest movies ever made. Its an absolute travesty that this didn't\\nwin the Oscar for Best Picture in 1994 although there was some stiff\\ncompetition.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThere are very few films that can simply blow a human being\\'s mind away\\nbut boy; Shawshank redemption does one hell of a job. From the very get\\ngo, Shawshank will have you on the edge of your seats.Tim Robbins, a man whose career was on an initial down hill slide with\\nflops such as Howard The Duck redeemed himself and then some with his\\nportrayal of a man who looses everything in a second and then spends 20\\nyears trying to get it all back. Robbins gave a calm misdemeanor to his\\ncharacter, which always gave the impression that he had something\\nplanned, that we were not expecting. Morgan Freeman gives, in my\\nopinion the best performance of his distinguishable career. He\\nmaintains a streetwise wisdom and this, too me, makes him the \"go to\\nguy\" of the prison. His calm yet intelligent nature is kept through out\\nthe film and does not seem affected by Andy but after the escape,\\nFreeman does superbly in showing the contrast in the streetwise dealer\\nof the prison to a man who misses his friend. Thomas Newman\\'s\\ncompelling score sets a dark and ominous tone and does what many scores\\ndon\\'t; it reflects the thought of the characters as opposed to the tone\\nof the scene. Darabont created a diverse prison world from the street\\nsmart ones, to the homesick ones to the rapists but I was not a fan of\\nhow racism was sidestepped in the movie. If I had one nit pick, and\\nthis is scraping the bottom of the barrel; I would have expected a few\\nracial slurs directed at some of the prisoners, particularly Red. It\\nwould have been true of the time but then again its not the point of\\nthe story.Ultimately, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece and has a powerful\\nyet happy enough ending to touch the heart of anybody.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nFear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free \\x96 These words\\ninscribed on the poster of The Shawshank Redemption sum up what's at\\nstake in Frank Darabont's chef-d'oeuvre. The Shawshank Redemption shows\\nus that there is hope even within the restricted walls of a prison.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)is a prominent banker wrongly convicted of\\nkilling his wife and her paramour, who spends many years in the\\nShawshank prison. He forges an unforgettable friendship with Red\\n(Morgan Freeman), a veteran of the penal system, who helps him to cope\\nwith the frightening realities of prison life. While the prison walls\\nshield Red and the other prisoners from the depredations of an\\never-changing world, it has the exact opposite effect on Dufresne, who\\nexploits every possible opportunity to bring a taste of the outside\\nworld to himself and his fellow convicts. Their bond forms the backbone\\nof the film.Tim Robbins is right at the top of his game as he paints a fascinating\\nportrait of an unjustly incarcerated inmate and brings an innate\\nhumanity to Stephen King's principal character. Freeman is exceptional\\nas Red and his narrative much of which is taken verbatim from King's\\nstory, holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a\\nbaton to orchestrate our emotions.Frank Darabont uses his powers as a supreme storyteller and an\\nastonishing craftsman to breathe life into a genre that I thought had\\nbeen dead since The Great Escape. He leaves us a poignant film with a\\npowerful message of hope, and redemption, masterfully told. The film's\\ngreatest triumph is its earnestness that makes even those moments that\\nmight have felt slushy, achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy. It is\\ndeeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on\\nfriendship and hope that can reduce the most hardened into misty-eyed\\nwonderment.The Shawshank Redemption warrants repeated viewing!\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThere\\'s nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about\\nmovies, and there\\'s no discussion as entertaining as fighting over\\nwhich was the best year for films. I always go for 1994, mainly because\\nit produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every\\nbest of list you can imagine. I mean, it\\'s pretty tough to find a\\nperson that doesn\\'t have either \"Forrest Gump\", \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"The\\nShawshank Redemption\" in their personal top ten. While the first two\\nmovies still have a considerable group of opponents (to some people\\n\"Forrest Gump\" is too much of a tearjerker, while \"Pulp Fiction\"\\napparently glorifies violence too much), \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is\\none of those movies nobody can really dislike. It\\'s a movie that goes\\nbeyond matters of taste, the story, writing and acting are so\\nundeniably good that it\\'s tough to come up with a counterargument.\\nWriter/director Frank Darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer,\\nparticularly when it comes to bit characters. You can also see this in\\nthe somewhat inferior \"The Green Mile\", characters who only have one or\\ntwo lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. The amazing\\nperformances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do the rest. The best\\nmovie ever made? It\\'s definitely up there.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nOften said to be one of the best films of all time, I can't help but\\nagree. No matter how many times I watch this over, I feel like it never\\nbores me and I am always captivated in a way that I've never felt with\\nany other film before.The Shawshank Redemption is a tale of hope, courage and betrayal, seen\\nthrough the eyes of prison inmates 'Andy' played by Tim Robbins, and\\nolder convict 'Red', portrayed by Morgan Freeman in an Oscar nominated\\nperformance. The film is set over 19 years in Shawshank prison, and\\ndepicts the life of Andy Dufresne, a hotshot banker and his struggle\\nwith keeping his mind and his sanity, whilst serving time for a crime\\nhe didn't commit. As Andy has to put up with harassment, distress and\\naffliction throughout the duration of his time at the prison, the film\\nillustrates a tale of eternal hope. As time slowly passes in the\\nprison, he's assisted by an older inmate by the name of 'Red' Redding\\n(Morgan Freeman), a black marketer who is 'known to locate certain\\nthings from time to time'. As the years pass by, Andy's friendship with\\nRed grows and so do the hardships they have to overcome.The film itself has touched me in many ways, it shows me just what\\npeople can do when they have a little faith and keep incessant hope no\\nmatter what. Obviously, Stephen King's greatest and most memorable big\\nscreen interpretation, one of which he is almost certainly proud of.\\nThe movie is a timeless classic that speaks to me and probably a lot of\\nothers on so many levels, providing a near perfect film with a great\\nplot line and representing a storyline with an even better message.Tim Robbins delivers an enthralling performance as the titular\\ncharacter, one that certainly stands out throughout the film whereas\\nMorgan Freeman's interpretation of fellow convict Red is just as\\ncaptivating, earning him recognition from the academy but not his\\nfellow co-star Robbins, obviously yet another Oscar snub.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption speaks out to its audience, as it\\nshows a tale of perseverance and perpetual hope when in the midst of\\nthe struggles in life. The film itself is possibly my favourite of all\\ntime and manages to keep my attention on the 10th time of watching it.\\nA must-see for anyone who has a good taste in films and is looking for\\na movie that will change their perspective on life and give them the\\nhope to pull through in the darkest of times.\\n\",\n",

Frank Darabont\\ndidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\\nlove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.

       " u'\\nThis is the best movie ever but I give you 15 Things You May Not Have\\nKnown About The Shawshank Redemption1. It\\'s Based on a Novella by Stephen King The film is based on Stephen\\nKing\\'s novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\" which was\\npublished in a short story collection called Different Seasons. Two of\\nthe other short stories in the collection were made into films, Stand\\nBy Me in 1986 and Apt Pupil in 1998. Only one of them, \"The Breathing\\nMethod,\" has not been turned into a movie.2. It\\'s Similar to Tolstoy King\\'s novella shares several plot points\\nwith a nine-page short story by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy called \"God\\nSees the Truth, But Waits.\" Both are about men sent to prison for\\nmurders they didn\\'t commit.3. Director Frank Darabont Got a Good Deal on the Rights to King\\'s\\nStory He bought the rights from King for $1.4. It Almost Had a Much Different Cast Castle Rock Entertainment, the\\nstudio that made Shawshank, was co-founded by Rob Reiner\\x97director of\\nanother King adaptation, Stand By Me\\x97and is named after the mythical\\nMaine town that provides the setting for many of King\\'s books. After\\ndirector Frank Darabont pitched Shawshank to the studio, Reiner\\noriginally offered $2.5 million for the script to star Tom Cruise as\\nAndy Dufresne and Harrison Ford as Red.5. The Original Title Was Changed to Avoid Confusion Darabont wrote the\\nscript in eight weeks before pitching it to Castle Rock Entertainment.\\nHe decided to drop the \"Rita Hayworth\" part of the novella because\\nactresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a\\nRita Hayworth biopic. During the casting process, Darabont even\\nreceived a call from an agent who represented a supermodel; he swore\\nthe script was the best she had ever read and that she\\'d be perfect for\\nthe (non-existent) part of Hayworth.6. It Was Filmed in Ohio Although the film is set in Maine, the Ohio\\nState Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio stood in for Shawshank Prison. The\\nstructure was slated to be torn down, but the production delayed the\\ndemolition for a year. After the film wrapped, all the buildings in the\\ncomplex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative\\nbuilding, which were preserved for historical purposes.7. Morgan Freeman Got Really Good at Catch The scene where Andy first\\napproaches Red about the rock hammer as Red plays catch in the main\\nyard took nine hours to shoot. Freeman continued to play catch for the\\nwhole nine hours without complaining and showed up the next day with\\nhis arm in a sling.8. The Film Was Inspired by Goodfellas Darabont says his main source of\\ninspiration was Martin Scorsese\\'s Goodfellas because of its use of\\nvoice-over narration and editing techniques.9. Voiceovers Are Tricky Business Originally, all of Morgan Freeman\\'s\\nvoice-over was recorded before any of the film was shot. The fact that\\nmuch of it syncs up to the on screen action (see: the scene on the roof\\nwhere the inmates drink beer) isn\\'t simple editing. Darabont would\\nplayback the recorded voice-over on-set during each take for the actors\\nto specifically play off of the audio. But the audio quality of his\\nvoice-over was too poor to include in the movie due to tape hiss, so\\nFreeman had to re-record the entire voice-over in post-production.10. They Got Lucky with One of the Most Famous Scenes Every take of the\\nfilm\\'s signature shot of Tim Robbins raising his arms outstretched in\\nthe rain after Andy breaks out of prison was out of focus except the\\none in the film. It was the final take shot for that scene.11. The Prop Guy Was a Jokester The visual joke of Andy\\'s rock hammer\\nbeing tucked into the Bible right after the first page of the Book of\\nExodus came from the film\\'s prop master Tom Shaw.12. None of the Close-up Shots of Andy\\'s Hands or Feet are Tim Robbins\\nThey\\'re director Frank Darabont.13. Stephen King\\'s Red Was Changed for the Film In the original\\nnovella, Red is described as a middle-aged Irishman.14. The Mug Shot of Young Red Isn\\'t Morgan Freeman It\\'s actually a\\nphoto of his son.15. The Tree Where Red Finds Andy\\'s letter Isn\\'t in Fort Hancock, Texas\\nIt\\'s in Ohio\\'s Malabar Farm State Park.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThis movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that\\nput you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to\\nfriendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling\\ncharacters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying\\nGame. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a\\nfit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off\\nhis goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion)\\nis shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State\\nPrison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a\\nbeautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a\\nspellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to\\n1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the\\nhellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of\\nbeatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire\\nhis fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red\\n(Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given\\ntime, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to\\nhimself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in\\nposter form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wise\\nguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the\\nturbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really\\nmean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with\\nfigures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting\\nscams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final,\\ngreatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift\\non too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such\\npoetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry\\nabout sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it\\nflopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience\\nyou will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nPrison is a gloomy and dark place that can contain beauty if worked on.\\nFriendships can be formed, enjoyment can be experienced, and freedom\\ncan sometimes be felt. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a very popular\\nfilm that contains world class film-making and interesting life-lessons\\nthat can be applied from prison to the free world. Tim Robbins stars as\\nAndy Dufresne, a banker who is convicted of murdering his wife, a crime\\nhe didn\\'t commit. After being sent to the Shawshank State Penitentiary\\nin Maine, Andy encounters some tough people including a brutal prison\\nguard and ruthless prisoners and lives in constant fear. Andy soon\\nmeets Red, a contraband smuggler with a life sentence played by Morgan\\nFreeman in the greatest performance of his life. The two form a special\\nfriendship and find how to make the best of their situation. As the men\\nget different jobs in the prison, attempt escape, and experience\\ndifferent feelings, the men try to redeem this depressing prison and\\nfind a better life. This story is an absolute cinematic icon and there\\nis no questioning as to why this is a classic work of art. The\\nfriendship formed between Andy and Red is one of the most fascinating\\nthings to watch form in cinema, as we get elaborate character\\ndevelopment and watch the unfolding of a beautiful friendship come to\\nlife in a depressing location. The extra tad\\'s such as the use of\\nforeshadowing and flashbacks writer Frank Darabont uses creative detail\\nand complexity to make this story special. Darabont also directs this\\nfilm and portrays a prison life in shockingly unique ways. He focuses\\non all the hardships that make prison seem nightmarish, but also shows\\nhow prison can be the best place on earth when you have a friend and\\nenjoyment in difficult situations. The themes of persistence and hope\\nthat are brought up in this film can relate to anyone\\'s situation\\nwhether free or in prison. Darabont adapts Stephen King\\'s story to show\\nus how in order to live we need freedom, and without hope you will\\nnever achieve it. This is a classic example of pure 90\\'s film-making\\nand stands as one of the best classics of all time. \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\" is one of the greatest narrative stories ever told and\\nbrings so much up that can inspire the world on how to achieve meaning\\nin life.\\n',\n",

We sometimes see some things as impossible, but with\\npersistence and determination, we can achieve something. The story of\\nthe movie is really shocking. We may find it boring on the early part\\nbut you would just surprise on the turn of events as the movie plays\\nthrough. You will really would not believe that a certain person could\\nmake a hole so long that you can make a way out. I can't still imagine\\nhow the main character made it. Well in life nothing is impossible as\\nlong as we want it happen. We must only believe of what we can do so we\\ncan be productive and successful. This movie is really worth watching.\\nYou may find it boring on the early part, don't be bothered, finish it,\\nsurely you will enjoy.\\n\",\n",

Yes,\\nit's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best\\nPicture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story\\nthat manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters\\nand superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked\\nit, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is\\nfantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in\\nthis. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same\\nballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal.\\n\",\n",

When I try to put my finger on why I like this more than\\nother feel good movies, I think it's largely because of the wonderful\\ncollision of brilliant characterisation and top-class performing that\\nis Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins.The character of Andy - humble but steely, quiet but intelligent,\\nsimple but cunning - is just perfect for this movie.

The most significant point for this\\nfilm, in my opinion related to actors or characters as Andy Dufrense\\nand Red. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played very convincing. I know\\nleading role was offered Tom Hanks. But I am very satisfied Tim Robbins\\nplayed this good role. On the other hand this film didn't have any\\nawards as Academy and Golden Globe. This fact trouble me. I think the\\nmost splendid episode in this film: when guards call the roll in the\\nmorning everybody exits their rooms expect Andy and most of people\\nsuppose that (as me) he committed suicide but he left.

       " u\"\\nAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife\\nand her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into\\nShawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King\\nshort story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.\\nFreeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of\\nthe story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It\\ncould have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman\\ngave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to\\nbe shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from\\nAndy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning.\\nWhen Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail\\nfrom the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an\\naha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison\\nfable.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nTalk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption\\n(Columbia, R), Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a tall, soft-spoken New\\nEngland banker, is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife\\nand her lover. It's 1947, and Andy, having received a double life\\nsentence, is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a\\nmaximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves,\\nrapists, and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank? So bad that when\\nAndy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates, the\\nveteran prisoners make wagers on who'll be the first to cry. So bad\\nthat Andy finds a huge, wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So\\nbad that, over the next two years, he is systematically beaten and\\nraped by the Sisters, a crew of leering renegade inmates who take\\nspecial delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake:\\nAndy gets worked over-and so does the audience.But then, good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie\\ncharacters. Early in his stay, Andy makes the acquaintance of Red\\n(Morgan Freeman), a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for\\nmurder and who acts as Shawshank's one-man black market, smuggling the\\nprisoners anything they want-cigarettes, reefer, cards with naked\\nladies (''I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck,'' he deadpans). As soon as\\nAndy bonds with Red, things start to ! look up. He gets hold of a rock\\nhammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. He does the guards'\\ntax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He\\nexpands the dusty, neglected book room into the most comprehensive\\nprison library in New England. Set over a period of 20 years (the\\npassing decades are marked by Andy's pinup posters of Rita Hayworth,\\nthen Marilyn, then Raquel), The Shawshank Redemption begins as a\\nnightmare, a postwar- New England Midnight Express, but it doesn't take\\nlong to reveal its true, feel-good colors. The movie is about survival,\\ntriumph, and a thing called hope. It's about a hero who rises above the\\nsqualor because he's blessed-a saint in the muck. It's Midnight Express\\nGoes Gump.You need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of\\nmanipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and there's no\\ndenying that Frank Darabont, who wrote and directed The Shawshank\\nRedemption (it's based on a short novel by Stephen King), knows just\\nwhat he's doing. The moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent\\nsensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison\\nwalls. And Darabont is an accomplished button pusher. He coaches the\\nactors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against.\\nWhen it comes to a character like the warden (Bob Gunton), all Bible-\\nthumping righteousness, the movie has no compunction about turning up\\nthe hissability factor. He starts out mean, then turns meaner, then\\nmeaner still. When Andy blasts Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over\\nloudspeakers to the prison work field, it becomes a full-scale\\nopera-soothes-the-savage-breast number, with the prisoners standing\\nopen-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The scene is meant to fire our\\nrighteous liberal hearts. It helps, of course, that most of the\\nprisoners don't actually behave like criminals. They never say a word\\nabout their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends\\nthe proceedings a hollow, generic feel, as if Darabont had constructed\\na blueprint out of old prison melodramas.A movie like The Shawshank Redemption, with its brazenly mechanical\\nplotting and its wish-fulfillment finale, requires a lead actor who can\\ncarry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and\\nlikable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards, and he makes you feel the\\ncharacter's mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a\\nlaconic- good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes\\nemotional contact with the audience. His face, foggy and placid,\\nsuggests an overgrown baby's; there's something naggingly unformed\\nabout him. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, with his delicate\\nsmolder, his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyone's soul,\\nmakes Red feel genuine, lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls, he\\nsays, ''First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em.After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's\\ninstitutionalized.'' With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just\\nthe right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one\\nof the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again, isn't it time\\nMorgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick? While we're on the\\nsubject of prison walls, an actor as great as he is shouldn't get too\\nused to movies like this one. B-\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nIn 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering\\nhis wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is\\nsentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State\\nPenitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\"\\nRedding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red\\nprocures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone\\nchess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth,\\nfollowed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch.\\nAndy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the\\n\"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy\\nBrown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs\\nhim about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the\\nSisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs\\nbeing sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel\\nNorton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison\\nlibrary to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a\\npretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice\\nand expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from\\nnearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state\\ngovernment for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside\\nworld after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a\\nlibrary donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro.\\nHe plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his\\nreceiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that\\nhe holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him,\\nbut Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison\\nlabor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs\\nand receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias\\n\"Randall Stephens\".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He\\njoins Andy\\'s and Red\\'s circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his\\nGeneral Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after\\nhearing the details of Andy\\'s case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at\\nanother prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder,\\nsuggesting Andy\\'s innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this\\ninformation, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in\\nsolitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an\\nescape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton\\nthreatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and\\npreferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary\\nconfinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a\\nMexican Pacific coastal town.

       " u\"\\nWithout doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human\\nsoul. Very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the\\nnovel. However this is one of those cases when it simply just does.This soul finding, awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great\\nadaptation of Stephen King's 1982 Novella entitled 'Rita Hayworth and\\nShawshank Redemption'.This is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the\\nworld and that with great perseverance 'anything can be over come'. Set\\nin the times of what looks like the depression and located within the\\nbackdrop of the sleepy south of America.A man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit, and how\\nthis alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he\\nwill be broken and beaten and either die or go mad (as so many of the\\ninmates succumb to). As Simon and Garfunkel had their books and poetry\\n'to protect them (me)' so the lead character Andy Dufresne has his to\\nprotect him from such failings. In Rita Hayworth he has a passage of\\nphysical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. He gains\\nrespect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his\\nmind and sheer willpower. Like a chess master he is thinking several\\nmoves ahead of everyone. Even the old master lag played by Morgan\\nFreeman can only watch this man from a distance. However he relays\\nthrough mainly past tense commentary how this man was as GB Shaw would\\nsay was 'Superman'. Eventually like a great master he exposes the\\nlies,hypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. This is not a\\nfilm but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the\\nlead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned\\neven if only for a passing moment in time. Like a bird on a journey he\\nis destined to be free. Enjoy this film because it may if only for a\\nmoment save your soul.\\n\",\n",

Frank Darabont\\ndidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\\nlove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.

       " u\"\\nThis was a reflection of the 'count of Montecristo', especially the\\njailbreak scene. But still i find it fascinating enough to impress me\\nand have a lot of ingredient included in it. This is probably the most\\namazing movies from the nineties apart from Forrestgump and back to the\\nfuture and all. It also reminded me of the series The Oz, Its cool and\\nall, but there's this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as\\nthe same in Hollywood a lot. probably so but i'm afraid that not to be\\ntrue.And one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused\\na number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is\\nreally complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed\\nby his love to who've been framed then jailed bitched from there and\\nrules there becomes everyone's favorite and the warden becomes his\\nworst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThis movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and\\ndeep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built\\non from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.\\nTim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was\\ninspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just\\nmade me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted\\nof murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but\\nyet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\"\\nRedding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest\\nperformance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep\\nregret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain\\naway is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with\\nAndy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy\\nalso becomes friends with the rest of Red\\'s group. James Whitmore also\\ngave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole\\nbut in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this\\nmovie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great\\ncinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but\\nnot in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares\\nmentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don\\'t listen to the people who say this movie is\\noverrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies\\never.

       " u'\\nThere is a reason the Shawshank Redemption has been at #1 of the IMDb\\ntop 250 for as long as I can remember. It is probably the best movie\\nthat has ever been made. Not because of the thrilling special effects\\n(it hardly has any). Not because of the daring, experimental\\ninnovations it has brought us (it is a quite straightforward movie).\\nBut because of its simple, beautiful storyline and its great\\ncharacters.\"They send you here for life. That\\'s exactly what they take.\" The\\nstrength of this movie is that Darabont is able to show what it means\\nto completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. To show\\nhow the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the\\nterrible life in Shawshank prison. We can truly understand how a man\\ncan become \\'institutionalized.\\' How people get used to living under a\\nrepressive regime and can\\'t face changing it. We see how the old Brooks\\ncan\\'t deal with the world around him and commits suicide. How Red faces\\nthe same challenges when he can\\'t take a leak without asking\\npermission. Inside the joint these men had a certain standing, they\\nwere important people. Being set free is not easy when your live has\\nbeen taken from you.- \"Why did you do it? - I didn\\'t, since you ask. - You gonna fit right\\nin.\"Half of the movie we don\\'t know for sure whether Andy is guilty or not.\\nIt doesn\\'t matter so much. What is important is not his past.\\nRehabilitated? What does that word even mean? In prison you live a\\nwhole different life. With whole different rules. Without a past. Or a\\nfuture. Andy is the exemption. He shows us the remedy against becoming\\ninstitutionalized. By never accepting our destiny. By never giving up.\\nBy always keeping our dreams alive.\"- There are places in the world that aren\\'t made out of stone. There\\nis something inside that they can\\'t touch. - What are you talking\\nabout? -Hope. - Let me tell you something my friend, hope is a\\ndangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. You better get used to\\nthat idea.\"But Andy doesn\\'t get used to that idea. He has received two things by\\nthe warden. \"Discipline and the bible.\" And he uses these two things to\\nget out and escape to the paradise called Zihujataneo. There are two\\nthings that make this movie so extremely good. The first thing is that\\nwe all can relate to Andy. \"I must admit, I didn\\'t think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on\\nhim. He had a quit way about him. A walk and a talk that just wasn\\'t\\nnormal around here.\"Andy is a normal guy. He is smart, he is doing good. But he is not\\nextremely strong, or extremely smart, or extremely rich. In other\\nwords: he is us. He is elevated a little bit above the criminals in\\nprison, but his two most important characteristics are characteristics\\nthat, deep down inside us, we all have: hope and determination. These\\ntwo emotion are so strong and so pure, that we all love to see the live\\nof Andy. That is what makes this movie so appealing.And by living just your live as best as you can, by never giving up and\\nby keeping your dignity at all times, we see that we can inspire\\npeople. Brooks was here. So was Red. Red didn\\'t choose that path of\\nBrooks. Red hasn\\'t become completely institutionalized. Because he\\nlived with Andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams.We, the normal movie-watchers, have never been to prison. And\\ncertainly, there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as\\nthe great Morgan Freeman, and this might be his best performance of his\\nlive. Darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let\\nyears pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. There\\nis a great soundtrack, which breathes the smell of Southern America\\ninto our living rooms. But I\\'m convinced that what makes this movie so\\ngreat is that it inspires us all.We are not stuck in a prison, but certainly we can be stuck in our\\nlives. Change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to\\nbecome institutionalized. We can have a life that seems to have no past\\nand not future. That seems to be unrelated to all the other things that\\nhappen in the world. Andy learns us to never give up. To never lose\\nfaith. To always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise.\"I guess it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living or get busy\\ndying.\"\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison\\ndrama with sensitive direction and fine performances.The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the\\nnovella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King.\\nHe adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning\\nthe film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is\\nalways better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here.\\nKing is a tremendous writer, but even he can\\'t shade and color the\\nprison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire\\nfilm. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well\\ndrawn in the film in large part because of Darabont\\'s script. Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the\\ntriumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will\\nlove \"The Shawshank Redemption\" because it sets a new standard for\\nfilms in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes\\nsentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent\\nin a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own\\nlives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single\\nOscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important.\\n',\n",

This film can not be replicated, because the film is\\nspecial; the Director wanted to make a piece of art of his film. The\\nmovie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you\\nsomewhere that you never been, and makes you feel you lived that\\nexperience, and you can learn from that experience. The lines\\ndelivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy\\ndying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).

       " u\"\\nThis is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to\\nwatch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around\\nmystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so\\nyou do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly\\nin a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious\\nand bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you\\nin each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You\\nneed adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those\\nare the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to\\navoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are\\ngoing to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this\\nmight not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie\\nsyncing with friends.

       " u'\\nOne of the masterpieces of Stephen King that became another memorable\\nmasterpiece for movies (and one of the most underrated films by the\\nAcademy).\"Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the most magnificent and beautiful\\nfilms ever made, is not the first time that another work of Stephen\\nKing becomes a must see classic. Thanks to Frank Darabont, the film\\nbecame unforgettable and also thanks to the magnificent history. Andy\\nDufresne (Tim Robbins) is a simple and shy bank worker, who after\\nseeing his wife with her lover, he threats to kill her. His wife and\\nher lover show up dead in the next day and Andy is sentenced to life\\nimprisonment in Shawshank institute where begins his great life story\\nwhen he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and a strong friendship starts\\nbetween this two during the long years of imprisonment. Andy manages to\\nbring many benefits to the prison and the prisoners, but only later\\nthat Andy discovers that his arrest was all a \"misunderstanding.\"The strongest points of the film is the screenplay of Darabont writing\\nand detailing the film with greater mastery possible by putting us in\\nthe place of Andy and get us feeling the tightness and claustrophobia\\nof prison. But at the same time with a very well-constructed dialog\\nthat narrates the film without blemish and without leaving any loose\\nend, leaving the story and his final message in greater perfection. A\\nstory that teaches the value of friendship and strong at the same time\\nof hope, one of the beautiful things in life and that we can never\\nabandon it or forget it.Not only the story is absolutely amazing and without any flaws, but the\\nperformances of each of the cast stand out, Morgan Freeman being\\nperfect as in all his roles. But who stands out is definitely Tim\\nRobbins with a show of perfection while maintaining its character as it\\nis, shy and who keeps to himself and does not try to be anything more\\nthan that.A film that is undoubtedly magnificent, a true masterpiece that should\\nbe watched over and over again to witness this spectacle emotionally\\nbreathtaking classic.\\n',\n",

The best ending scene of this movie I have ever scene\\nshowing kind of Deja-Vu and Divine feeling to me. It is the movie about friendship and slow-redemption. You might not\\nblink for a second to see what next it would lead to. Each character is\\nfitted to their roles perfectly and they have given a flawless\\njustification to that.

       " u\"\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal movie with a very well\\ndeveloped storyline, outstanding character development and a fantastic\\ncast. It's almost immediately engaging, I found myself engrossed by the\\nstory from the very first scene, as we follow Andy Dufresne in his\\njourney in to prison, we feel the characters emotions, even without\\nthem being properly exposed and as the film progresses we see him form\\nrelationships in Shawshank prison that add a lot of depth. The\\ncharacter development in this movie is ridiculously well written and is\\nwhat writers should look towards as inspiration, the relationship\\nbetween Andy and Red, Brooks' entire story arch, the Warden and\\nCaptain's partnership, it's all very believable, as well as captivating\\nthanks to a terrific script by Frank Darabont. The performances are all\\nabsolutely outstanding, Tim Robbins emotional, enclosed personality as\\nAndy is terrific, Bob Gunton's sinister delivery, Clancy Brown's\\nthreatening persona, James Whitmore's innocent, uneducated attitude, it\\nall comes together to create engaging, realistic people. However, the\\nundeniable star of the show, and the main reason this film is #1 on\\nIMDb's Top 250 has to be Morgan Freeman, his portrayal of Red is\\nimmediately enticing, he's a pure, honest man who keeps the story\\nmoving with narration, Freeman's voice-over work for this film adds\\nthat extra layer that was very necessary and added so much more power,\\nhis dialogue with Robbins is some of the best acting I have ever seen,\\nand the moment in which he speaks about his parole for the final time\\nis possibly the highlight of this amazing actors entire career. Very\\nengaging, emotional, The Shawshank Redemption is a long movie, but I\\nnever found myself wanting it to end, and I would highly recommend it\\nto anyone looking for a good drama. Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two lifetimes in prison when he is\\nconvicted for killing his wife and her secret lover. He is miserable in\\nShawshank prison, but soon makes friends in the wise Red.

When I finally decided to see it, I immediately regretted\\nnot watching it any sooner. The film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start, but in the\\nend, you would truly feel redemption. You could feel the pain and\\ninjustice brought upon Andy, the protagonist. As I watched the movie, I\\nfelt as if I was in prison with him; I felt as if I've gone through the\\nstruggles that he went through as well. You could see how time is\\nirrelevant in prison; you feel minutes go by when it's actually days,\\nweeks, months, and years. And then you'll feel disappointed at all\\nthose years where you could have done something different in the world\\noutside.The film is also an eye-opener. You open your eyes to what its like in\\nprison; although, the prison in the movie seems more ideal than real\\nlife prisons. You get a glimpse of brutality and rape inside prison.\\nYou get to see how some prisoners become institutionalized and never\\nseem to want to leave anymore. There is also a depiction of how rampant\\ncorruption is, and its sad to think that those involved are the ones\\nwho are supposed to be protecting and abiding by the law.The cast is great. I couldn't ask more from Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman. Even the other prisoners are good too. Overall, I think that\\nthe main point of this movie is never to lose hope; that hope is always\\na good thing. This movie is as equally good as Forrest Gump and Pulp\\nFiction (movies that were made in the same year as this), but I can't\\nunderstand why only these two movies got most of the attention. All in\\nall, this movie certainly is the kind of movie to watch before you die.\\n\",\n",

How Morgan Freeman didn't get a\\nbest supporting Oscar for this film, I'll never figure out.Wonderful, amazingly written film. The cast are superb (Tim Robins\\nalways underrated as an actor). Pulls you through every emotion. If you haven't seen this film then you\\nyou don't know what you've been missing.

Every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies, the 70's\\nhad The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, the 80's had Platoon and Raging\\nBull the 90's had The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction and the\\n2000's had Gladiator and The Lord Of The Rings. There were a lot of\\ngood films in the 90's and this is up there with the best . The story\\nis about a man called Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly\\nconvicted and sent to the Shawshank Prison. When there he meets Red\\n(Morgan Freeman) and then the story takes off. The acting is incredible\\nand Freeman and Robbins deliver the performances of their career, the\\nscript is incredible (another great collaboration between Steven King\\nand Frank Darabont) and it didn't win one single Oscar! This could have\\nbeen good enough for three Oscars at the least, true, the competition\\n(Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction) were good films but, The Shawshank was\\ncertainly good enough to win a couple.So if you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, buy it, rent it and\\nwatch one of the most powerful and moving films ever, be prepared to be\\nblown away.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\"Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no\\none expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not\\x85 but\\none of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM\"Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long\\ntime in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his\\nwife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a\\nman can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an\\nounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a\\nslowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees\\nDufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many\\nother scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock\\nfull of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by \"Red\" (Morgan\\nFreeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even\\nin the worst circumstances, within the \"hell on earth\" they can\\nmaintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan\\nFreeman is the film\\'s secret strength, playing \"the guy who can get it\\nfor you\" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early\\nscene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel\\nhead guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don\\'t know whether Red\\nlooks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he\\njust lost betting the guy wouldn\\'t break before Dufresne James Whitmore\\nwas equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the\\noutside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that\\npeople who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some\\nsort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore,\\nfreedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time\\nfavorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in\\nfreedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched\\nunforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film\\nshows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison\\nsurvival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.\\nAn outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners.\\nMany social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a\\nwell-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have\\ntied with the winner, the equally good \"Forrest Gump.\"My Rating - 10/10\\n',\n",

I highly recommend this to anyone who\\nwants a brilliant film. 10/10. (side note, this is my only 10/10 film)It is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists.

No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie, whether\\nit's the first time watching it, or your tenth. Just sat down and\\nwatched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter (12).

I\\'s indeed very overwhelmed & enthusiastic about the movie.(you\\nknow, that much publicity takes the excitement to the extreme level)\\nNow, talking about the movie, it is a story of a man who gets life\\nimprisonment sentence for a crime which he didn\\'t commit. Here it\\nremembers me about the classical Russian novella named \\'The Kreutzer\\nSonata\\' by \"Leo Tolstoy\". It seems to me a bit inspired from that.\\nIndeed. The rest of the story line is different. It specifically a\\nstory of a man\\'s struggle (in which he got succeed) to come out of the\\nprison (by hook or crook, take it your own way) and proved himself\\ninnocent after the hard sufferings of 19 years imprisonment. The whole\\nstory tells about the moral to heed i.e. \"Hopes Never Die.\" I really\\ncan keep this movie on my All-time favorite movies list. It deserves\\nso, Btw. This is some of among those movies in which I didn\\'t check the\\nduration even a single time. And, during the whole movie I was just\\nsitting on the edge of my chair with wide open my eyes & my mind (off\\ncourse). And, for now, with classiness of this movie in my brains & off\\ncourse terrible sleep in my eyes, I\\'m no more in situation to write\\nanything else. But one thing I\\'d make sure that very soon I\\'m gonna\\nread \\'Stephen King\\'. And, At the last I\\'d like to halt my review by one\\nof the dialogues of the movie, Which I liked a lot, \"Get busy living or\\nget busy dying.\" And, I\\'m really nowhere an obtuse to just review it\\nlike a blind-head Ass. Lol :) Remember Hope is a good thing.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nI absolutely love The Shawshank Redemption. When a movie gives me\\ngoosebumps, it has done its job. Where to start. The acting in this\\nmovie is sublime. I had never seen any movie starring Tim Robbins, but\\nMorgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Tim Robbins portrays an\\nintriguing man. He and Morgan Freeman work together extremely well.The story itself is brilliant. A banker, wrongfully put in prison would\\nnot seem that interesting, but with these people and their\\nconversations and companionship it's certainly worth a watch. I was sad\\nwhen I thought the director killed off Andy Dufresne at the end, but\\nwhen I realised he had actually escaped I couldn't stop smiling until\\nthe movie was over. This movie certainly deserves the #1 spot in the\\ntop 250 movies, as it's a must see for everyone.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nWhat can i say, its shaw shank. I don't refer the film as the shaw\\nshank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what I'm on\\nabout when i say its my favourite (and i only seen it in April 2012).\\nThe story is well known as Andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double\\nmurder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red (played by\\nthe awesome Morgan freeman). Over time in the movie he adapts to life\\nin prison and escapes and becomes a free man. How did a movie this so\\nsimple become beloved by so many. How? I don't know how and i don't\\ncare but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and\\nalready became a success years later. Although it did not great at the\\nbox office yet critics praised it well, years later people discovered\\nit on VHS. I wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would\\nhave struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. A\\ndiscovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of\\nthe film being very good and after seeing it, it is more than just\\ngood. I may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it\\nunlike many other films (except the lion king of the return of the king\\nhit me right in the soft spot). I didn't cry at the end, i smiled at\\nthe end. What a film.The good of the film, the acting from freeman. Although he lost to\\nhanks in Forrest gump for best actor, i don;t care as hanks did as much\\nas a good job as freeman did (if better). Tim Robbins was also amazing\\nand likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest\\nlevel. The score is beautiful, the mies en scene, the scripting writing\\nis gold and genius making this a classic. This film is not complex and\\nit is something that makes it just so darn good. The pacing is perfect\\nand the narration from freeman is timeless. The iconic shots of Andy\\nraising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be\\nattempted when finishing school (as i have did).A film highly recommend by me and others as well, touched me to the\\npoint of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will\\nlive as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nWhenever I see a prison or even think about it, the first thing that\\ncomes to my mind is this film. Maybe it\\'s because I have watched this\\nmasterpiece so many times that it\\'s actually made a place inside my\\nhead and will never go away. I just cannot explain how well this film\\nis made. The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact\\nthat it is based upon \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" by\\nStephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by\\nTim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd \"Red\"\\nRedding, they shine just like a diamond, stupendous performances by\\nthem. I still can\\'t believe that it never got any major accolade and\\ndidn\\'t even make much money but still it has developed into something\\nsensational which can\\'t be missed.\\n',\n",

Without special\\neffects or a large budget, The Shawshank Redemption became my third\\nposter because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance. Each are excellent.

       " u\"\\nWhat can I add to all the other reviews here? Just my own feelings\\nabout this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times,\\nemotionally, I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves\\naround in my head, heartbroken, paranoid and not well physically. Total\\nmess.My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film\\nto watch. I initially resisted, thinking it was going to be\\nlightweight, PC fare. I don't know why I thought that.There's a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see\\nwhat kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time,\\nand you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying\\nover the prison, and I think by then you're hooked.This scene is deeply moving, not least because of the music. It's\\ndifficult to see how Thomas Newman's music for this film could possibly\\nbe bettered - perfectly listenable to in it's own right, but when you\\ndo you're reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun, enjoying their\\nfirst beer for so long. They've been touched by Andy's kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown\\nback in one's face, but other times a gesture of gratitude is given\\nback - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and\\na powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely\\nscars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also\\nfull of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a\\ntriumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling, but as I\\nwatched the end I could not contain my tears, unusually.So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me, and no\\ndoubt for many others\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\"I have been thinking for a while to watch \" Shawshank\\nRedemption\"(1993) the number one movie on IMDb list 9.2/10,finally did\\nit, its a excellent example of good story telling ,one of the story\\nthat makes u think and touches your soul, this movie is all about hope\\n,hope in bad times & not letting it go whatever is the situation ,hope\\nthat one day u will have your laugh,hope to be loved again,hope to\\nachieve something big,hope to breath free. Andy Dufresne (Tim\\nRobbins)not only was hopeful for himself in the his bad time but made\\nhis prison mates hopeful by providing them feel of freedom through\\nbooks and music,he also gave his best prison mate Red (Morgan Freeman)\\nreason to live once he made it out from the prison. and as Tim Robbins\\nsays \"hope is one of the good things and good things never dies\".\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and\\narticulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her\\npersevere against impossible odds, especially so when he/she is facing\\na terrible injustice. This reminds me of Viktor Frankl's book 'Man's\\nSearch for Meaning' based on his experiences in prison under far worse\\nconditions than depicted in this film. It is only under the harshest\\nand most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being\\nwhose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question\\nof the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and\\nthe meaning of freedom. The only real freedom that human beings have\\nlies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging\\ncircumstances that one faces, and in that creative expression one finds\\nmeaning. No one can give that freedom and no one can take away that\\nfreedom \\x96 its source is within, and completely independent of external\\ncircumstances and institutions. All institutions tend to inhibit this\\nfreedom and instead 'confine' individuals so that they become\\n'institutionalized'. The prison is the toughest of all institutions.\\nBut the tougher the conditions, the greater is the challenge and if\\nunderstood that way, the greater the rewards in finding meaning. But\\nuntil that is accomplished, one must have something essential and\\nsubstantial to believe in \\x96 call it hope or faith or self esteem \\x96 in\\norder to survive, for nothing is accomplished in death. At the same\\ntime, the idea of death itself is the motivating force \\x96 a sense that\\none could die without having achieved anything in life is the most\\npowerful life sustaining force itself \\x96 this is the most stupendous\\nparadox of human existence, something that was hinted at in Joseph\\nHeller's Catch 22. At the centre of this catch is the hope (a word much\\nabused) that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of\\nconditions, that one will be able to forge something good out of the\\nentire BS that surrounds us. And that which is good lasts forever. That\\nis the true faith, not the false faith of the corrupt Warden, who in\\nthis case is not only the proverbial 'devil who is fond of quoting from\\nthe scriptures' but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a\\n'man of God' only because of his fanatical devotion to the Bible. The\\nirony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. The ending was\\nthe best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated\\n'Greek Tragedy', as the central message of the film was that hope\\nwithin one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would\\nhave given up, and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between\\nhumans, in this case between two very different kind of humans, both by\\nbackground as well as race, but who become the best of friends because\\nthey share something vital deep inside that makes them 'to get busy\\nliving' rather than to 'get busy dying'. Finally, what makes this one\\nof the greatest movies is that it also has drama, adventure and action\\nwhich makes it appealing to a wide audience. For the serious, it can\\nrevisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes \\x96 a\\nmood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking.\\n\",\n",

The opening is a brilliantly done\\nsequence with Andy\\'s (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on\\nthe night of his crime.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who\\nis sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan\\nFreeman\\'s Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen\\nKing\\'s short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" (in the\\nfilm version, it\\'s really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the\\nultimate twist). On the surface, it\\'s another prison-genre picture with\\nthe usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few\\nhomosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn\\'t want his parole.\\nHowever, the film\\'s emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well\\nserved by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out\\namazing, three- dimensional characterizations.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI'll always remember watching this film when i was younger, it was one\\nof the first films that ever gave me that 'mind-blowing' experience you\\nsometimes get when you've seen a brilliant movie. Tim Robbins gives\\nwhat is undoubtedly for me his best performance as Andy, who is such an\\ninspiring character that you find yourself truly rooting for even in\\nthe early stages of the film. Morgan Freeman gave a stellar\\nperformance, arguably his best also, as Red, Andy's cell mate another\\ncharacter you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. This is a film i will never tire of, if you haven't watched it for\\nwhatever reason, you should do! A solid 10/10 for me! enjoy.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis movie was released when I was all of 9 years old. Lucky for me, I\\ndidn\\'t come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. I have\\nalways been a movie buff and, aside from that, a big fan of the\\nwritings of Stephen King. I had read the short story the film is based\\non and it led me to this film, which I was certainly aware of prior but\\nnever checked out. Afterwards, I had a new list of benchmarks for\\ncertain aspects of cinema.First and foremost was the story itself. The writing of this tale, in\\nscreenplay form, is absolutely brilliant. The story is fleshed out\\nwithout lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger\\nin, and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building\\nemotional atmosphere. From the early feelings of confusion and bitter\\njustice (as our main character is judged by his peers) to the dawning\\nrealization of what Shawshank Penitentiary has to offer for it\\'s masses\\nof convicted felons. It all flows fabulously, as the tale unwinds from\\nthe darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and\\npalpable hope Andy and Red seem to cultivate for the rest of the\\nprisoners. It\\'s this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that\\nis at the forefront of The Shawshank Redemption\\'s impact.Second, but just as vital, was the casting. Tim Robbins has always\\nbeen, in my mind, a criminally underrated acting talent. He always\\nseems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner\\nstrength, and in that conflict one always questions his motivation, his\\nreason for doing things. His skill set was married perfectly to the\\ncharacter of Andy Dufrense, who instantly seems in mortal danger within\\nthe walls of Shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and\\nsteel. Indeed, it\\'s safe to say that, mentally at least, Andy spent\\nvery little time in that prison.Morgan Freeman played the role of Red Redding in a manner that, I\\nthink, no other actor could have done. He was not only a veteran of\\nShawshank, he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of\\nbrotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well\\nto Freeman\\'s on-stage abilities. As a \"man who can get things\", Red is\\ninstrumental in many inmates\\' lives in Shawshank. Offering a variety of\\ncontraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated\\npeoples (cigarettes, petty cash), Red is as important a character as\\nAndy in terms of the film\\'s overall message of hope despite\\nhopelessness. And Morgan Freeman was the best man for that job.The excellent acting doesn\\'t end there. Bob Gunton, who seems to find a\\nniche in playing white-collar criminal types, portrays the warden of\\nShawshank as a sinister, scheming man who hides his darker desires\\nbehind the Bible and an arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude. William\\nSadler is another outstanding character actor, similar to Gunton, whose\\nface is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as Heywood.\\nOne of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right\\nhand of the warden, Guard Officer Hadley, who was portrayed by Clancy\\nBrown, well known for his bad-ass-type roles. His no-nonsense,\\nhard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but\\nappreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesn\\'t exist.Beyond the writing and the acting, this movie was perfect in every\\nother aspect. I\\'ve seen it many times over the years, often turning to\\nit, perhaps subconsciously, during particularly rough or depressing\\npatches. I\\'ve very rarely come across a film that not only meets my\\nexpectations, but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly\\ncomparing future films to it. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those\\nfilms, where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of\\neveryone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. A masterpiece\\nof modern film-making that has lost none of it\\'s impact or relativity\\nnearly 20 years later.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nWhat is there to say about this movie, except it is a triumph in film\\nmaking. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is\\ngoing to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end,\\nthis ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact\\nthat this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There\\nis no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men\\ntalking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win\\neven when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie\\nthat just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the\\nsimple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is\\ndefinitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your\\nday. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in\\ncinematic history.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI saw this movie for the first time 8 years ago. I just happened to see\\nit by chance on cable because I never heard about \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\" before. After watching the movie I was immensely impressed\\nand positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I\\'ve ever\\nseen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and\\nGil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that\\nspot in the rankings. This movie is a \"must see\"! The movie not only offers a great viewing experience but also a lesson\\nto take home. Wish more movies are made in this fashion instead of the\\nblood and gore that people seem to appreciate nowadays.Thanks for reading this review.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nShawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there\\nhands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is\\nsentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret\\nlover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the\\nworst while he goes through the first initial weeks in\\nShawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the\\ncourse of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some\\npush on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of\\nlessons from each other and become really great friends over their\\ncourse of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only\\nenticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this\\nmovie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a\\nman sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and\\nwhat it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important\\nlesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take\\nvirtually everything away from you including your pride and your\\ndignity, they can never take your Hope.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nIf you want to see hope in its most poetic and dramatic sense, choose\\nThe Shawshank Redemption. I commend it to everyone who thinks movies\\nare more than source of 'entertainment',that they are mirrors of life\\nand its moral lessons. I cannot find any other movie with such\\ncompelling touch of hope, faith and love. You will understand what\\nredemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if\\nwe let it reign inside of us.From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of\\neach character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office\\ntitle. It may have not won Best Picture but for me, it is the Best\\nPicture by far.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nLet me start out by saying that this is one of my personal all time\\nfavorites and as such I may be a bit bias whole reviewing it. On the\\nother hand, there\\'s a reason it\\'s a personal favorite. The movie revolves around the wrongly imprisonment of Andy Dufrane\\n(played by Tim Robbins) for the murder of his wife. The story focuses\\non Andy\\'s life in prison, relationships with other inmates\\n(particularly with \"Red\" played perfectly by Morgan Freeman) and\\npassion for life and freedom. I recently had an argument with one of them regarding this movie. He\\nclaimed it was \"too plain\" to be considered so great; my view was (and\\nis) that it maybe be plain, but it\\'s superb. The movie touched me when\\nI saw it, Brooks\\' long life in prison (amazing acting by James\\nWhitmore), Red\\'s pragmatic persona and Andy\\'s unyielding will and hope,\\nall combines to an amazing movie.In my opinion this isn\\'t some regular \"feel good movie\", it\\'s much\\nmore. It may be plain as my friend said, low on visual effects or\\noutstanding camera work \\x96 but it\\'s plainly superb. The texts send\\nshivers down your spine, Frank Darabont\\'s screenplay adaption to\\nStephan King\\'s short story are brilliantly executed by the amazing cast\\nand in the end that\\'s what really matters.I was moved when the movie ended, viewed it and prison differently, I\\nexpect it\\'ll remain as a cult favorite despite the \"no impressive\\neffects and mediocre camera work\" as my friend put it.Go watch it if you haven\\'t already, it\\'s in my opinion one of the best\\nmovies of all time.\\n',\n",

Call me a snob I don't think you cannot call\\nyourself a movie buff, unless you've seen this movie.The plot revolves around an innocent banker sent to prison charged of\\nmurder of his wife and befriends an old friendly character portrayed\\nperfectly by Morgan Freeman.

Some say it is too over rated\\nand that might be true but there's no doubt it is a fantastic and well\\nexecuted film. The acting is good. Morgan Freeman is an excellent\\nnarrator. William Sadler is also good. You can't help but laugh with\\nHaywood.The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant story of, hope, friendship and\\nobviously redemption.

       " u\"\\nI avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim\\nprison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it\\nis set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship,\\nhonesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to\\nreally try and not give away too much of the film because if you\\nhaven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in\\na prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since\\nthe early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and\\nno rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have\\nlost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such\\ninmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He\\ntries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs\\nto desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily\\ntaking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to\\ndiscern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a\\ntale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and\\ngrace. This is a film that I will see again and again.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nwhat a narration..???,One of my all time favorites. Shawshank\\nRedemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of\\nfriendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great\\nperformance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob\\nGunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison\\nguard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore\\'s portrayal of an\\nelderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every\\nactor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

       " u'\\nEDITEDIn 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a\\ndouble murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He\\'s\\nsentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where\\nanother lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the\\nnew recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities\\nof prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob\\nGunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and\\ninmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or\\nbeatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the\\nhope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him\\nto prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with\\nthe warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton\\'s illegal\\nbusiness schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the\\nprison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and\\nbring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including\\nRed. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the\\ndirectorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.what a spectacular movie it is. i remember seeing this movie when i was\\na child but couldn\\'t remember much of it so i decided to watch this\\nmovie now once again. people are not crazy when they think it is one of\\nthe best movies of all time. almost half of the world population might\\nhave seen it, maybe the second most loved movie after The Godfather.one of my very most favorite movies of all time, one of the best movies\\never made, a highlight of 1994. this truly is an Masterpiece, a pure\\nwork of genius. a near perfect classic movie. a movie that will never\\nget old, a memorable movie. will always be remembered. it was nominated\\nfor 7 Oscars unfortunately didn\\'t won any, Best Picture, Adapted\\nScreenplay, Cinematography, Editing, Sound, Original Score and Actor in\\na Lead Role Morgan Freeman. Best Picture that year wen\\'t to Forrest\\nGump.story of this movie just so wonderful with so much to say in layers. it\\nis story of Tim Robbins as Andy who is been falsely accused of murder\\nis being jailed in Shawshank, there he meet Morgan Freeman as Red, he\\nand other cellmates becomes friend. Andy is a weird and unique inmate\\nthere which when i found what he did or was doing just shocked me, he\\nis jaw dropingly genius. he becomes a personal banker to a corrupt and\\nvery cruel warden sameul played by Bob Gunton and his other men. he\\nsecretly works on his own legal case while he is educating and trying\\nto improve lives of his other cell mates, he makes them read and study\\nsince he himself is an educated man. he escapes from jail too in the\\nend, which is an epic scene to me.this movie stars Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Bill Sadler,\\nClancy Brown , James Whitmore , Gil Bellows , Mark Rolston , Jeffrey\\nDeMunn , Dion Anderson , Ned Bellamy , Bill Bolender , Larry\\nBrandenburg , Brian Brophy and others. Tim Robbins gave a good\\nperformance, just like he did in Mystic River but this time you may see\\nhim smile too. i like his performance, did justice to his character. i\\nliked him when i saw this movie first. then there is Mr. Morgan Freeman\\nas Red which according to me was a 100% perfect casting, he was very\\ngood in his character, delivered a very good performance. this movie\\noverall features good performances. and i like both the characters of\\nboth Andy and Red, memorable characters they are. and also their\\nchemistry was so good in this movie.Directed by Frank Darabont whose only movie i remember after this one\\nis The Green Mile and TV Series The Walking Dead. he really did a good\\njob in this movie, superb work indeed. truly impressive. screenplay of\\nthis movie is excellently written. superbly executed. you will love the\\nway this movie grows on you completely and completely takes over. i was\\nhooked to this movie. Editing of this movie was really good. good\\ncinematography and art direction. just a good of everything. good score\\ntoo ofciurse.this is one of the best prison movies, a truly heart touching,\\ninspiring, uplifting thought provoking, timeless, sad movie that will\\nbe loved by every person with a soul in them. a very moving movie. i\\nloved it truly, very lovable movie that i don\\'t even need to recommend\\nit to you. Most of you have seen it but if by any chance not, THE A\\nMUST MUST WATCH.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI Watched the movie 16 years after its release. I must admit that i\\nwatched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list.\\nI wasn\\'t disappointed. Rather felt a sense of victory. It doesn\\'t have\\nany action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is\\none of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that\\nyou may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel\\nthe same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. This movie\\nhad the most powerful cast and amazing script, and all based on an\\nawesome prison drama novel by horror-master Stephen King!Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in\\n1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the\\nnext 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting\\nnot only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a\\nbrutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while\\ntelling his charges that \"salvation lies within.\" Andy\\'s stubborn\\nrefusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the\\nwonder and friendship of several inmates, especially \"Red\" Redding\\n(Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy\\'s state of mind.Robbins depicts Andy Dufresne to be a reserved, humble protagonist. It\\nis well-known that other actors were considered to play this role, such\\nas Tom Hanks, but I believe Robbins\\'s presence works wonders for the\\nstoryline, allowing Andy to have a quiet temperament that lets him seem\\nat peace with himself. He has nothing on his resume close to his\\nperformance here. Freeman puts on arguably the greatest performance of\\nhis lifetime in this movie. His narration lets the viewer connect even\\nfurther with all the characters, and has a poignance that stays with\\nyou long after the credits roll. His \"rehabilitated\" speech ranks right\\nup there as one of the all-time great movie moments.Character development is greatly utilized here. Pop culture references\\n(Rita Hayworth, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy) help give one the\\nimpression of the passage of years, and Andy\\'s brave, witty exploits\\nmake him a likable hero. Violence and death are also put to use, with\\nseveral characters dying within the story. We are made to embrace these\\nseemingly real individuals during their airtime, and are hence moved by\\ntheir tragic deaths. The failures of these characters make the final\\nscenes of the film all the sweeter.Another standout feature of The Shawshank Redemption is the music. Oh,\\nthe music! Thomas Newman\\'s musical score shines brightly and lends\\nanother dimension to this heartfelt tale. The triumphant piece heard at\\nthe end is one that you\\'ve likely heard before \\x97 as it has been used in\\nmovie trailers all over the world. The fact that The Shawshank\\nRedemption did not win an Oscar for its musical score (or in any\\ncategory for that matter) is almost incomprehensible. Though in a \\'94\\nclass along with Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King, I\\nsuppose it can be understood.I will note that it is a definite \\'must see\\' for all those who consider\\nthemselves \"movie connoisseurs\". There are not too many negatives (if\\nany) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it\\'s current\\n#1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though.I guess I\\'m a little nit-picky, but my main beef is with the ending.\\nThe whole movie is about hope. *SPOILERS ALERT* If you wanted hope,\\nthen you should not have ended on a cheesy last scene where the old\\nfriends reunite and everything is alright. *SPOILERS END* It was\\ntouching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by\\nour excitement that the two friends are together again. We leave the\\nmovie smiling instead of thinking. What I\\'m trying to say is that to\\nmake the core message stick to the viewers, the movie should have ended\\nthe scene before, when Red boards the bus and says, \"I hope I can make\\nit across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I\\nhope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams\\x85 I hope.\" And\\nas the bus drives away from the camera, the credits roll. But again,\\nthat\\'s only an honest opinion.Watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you\\ninvolved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. I recommend it to\\neveryone who enjoys watching beautiful cinema. I rate it 9 out of 10.For the end i leave Andy Dufresne\\'s quote \"Hope is a good thing, maybe\\nthe best of things, and no good thing ever dies\"\\x85\\n',\n",

During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely\\nfriendship with smoke dealer \"Red\", portrayed by the astounding Morgan\\nFreeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his\\nsmoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks\\nabout Andy\\'s struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the\\nunexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an\\nastounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of\\nthe mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped\\nbring King\\'s vision to life on the screen, and he performed an\\nexcellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a\\ntrue miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play\\nthe most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan\\nFreeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore\\nplays such a dramatic small role as \"Brooks\", the Shawshank librarian.\\nAlso, I enjoyed Thomas Newman\\'s breathtaking score, the perfect\\ncinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular\\nscript. I respected every single moment in this movie, and it had me\\nwanting for more. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the best movies\\never made, and I have never seen a movie with so much heart before,\\neven though of it\\'s slow 142 minute run-time. \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\", in my review, \"a stunning masterpiece, entertainment at\\nits finest\".\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nWhat can be said that already hasn't been. Shawshank Redemption is a\\nspectacular film which focuses on Hope and fear. Morgan Freeman does\\nwhat he always does, delivers a fine, unforgettable performance. With a\\nvoice like that it extremely hard too. As Red, Freeman narrates the\\ntale of how a man wrongly accused of Murder, is sent to life in prison\\nand has nothing but hope to cling on.Stephen King epitomise great storytelling. You don't need twists every\\nscene nor do we need a complex plot that tries to hard to stand out.\\nWith colourful characters and fantastic interactions, a story can truly\\nbecome personal. OK, many here has probably never been sent to prison\\nfor something they didn't do but this doesn't stop anyone from\\nimagining the fear and hopelessness that one must go through when\\nstripped from their freedom and rights.There only few films out there that makes the most out off every shot.\\nShawshank is one of those. There not one wasted second, no scene which\\ncould or should of been cut from the final version. Everything is done\\nto perfection. You can feel and sense the delinquency and effort put\\ninto the film which luckily for us, makes the viewing that extra\\nspecial.Pointless it may seem, writing a review for a film which has already\\nbeen critique to death, but heck, a little more praise won't do any\\nharm. Yes, you will get your snobs who will bang on about how this film\\ndoesn't deserve to be number one, but those are the ones who believe a\\nstory must be plagued by thought provoking twists. All i have to say is\\nthat Shawshank is a heart warming tale that will no doubt leave you in\\na fuzzy ball of warmth and amazement when the credits begin to roll\\ndown on this extraordinary tale\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" isn\\'t only a movie these days; it\\'s a\\nstatement of purpose for underdogs and anyone who ever felt trapped\\nunderfoot by a system they didn\\'t understand. Yet watching the film\\nwith that knowledge doesn\\'t obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying\\nemotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in\\n1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover.

There\\'s enough\\ncleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood\\nblockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players.\\nBased on the Stephen King novella, \"Rita Hayworth And Shawshank\\nRedemption,\" it\\'s the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the\\npowerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who\\nuses Freeman\\'s narration to inject King\\'s voice into the proceedings.Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast,\\nhis quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film\\n\"Harvey\" Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the\\nfilm\\'s secret strength, playing \"the guy who can get it for you\" with a\\nnote of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat,\\nnew convict (\"fresh fish\") is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain\\nHadley (Clancy Brown), you don\\'t know whether Red looks so crestfallen\\nfor the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the\\nguy wouldn\\'t break before Dufresne.\"Shawshank\" is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile,\\njustice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too\\non-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true\\nand natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details,\\nthat you can\\'t really deny this film\\'s classic status, nor want to.\\nIt\\'s a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message\\ntouches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of\\nShawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the\\nidea that however dark and embroiled in life\\'s miseries we become, its\\nbelief that \"a warm place without memory\" is not out of reach pulls us\\nin. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so\\ninclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other\\nlevels, too.Finally, it\\'s a great story, well told. People will always have a need\\nfor such stories, especially when the things they tell us are as fine\\nand noble as they are here. Andy wants out of \"Shawshank\" bad, but for\\nviewers it turns out being a fine place to serve time in.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nStephen King is my favourite author and I like most of his books and\\nlove some as well. One of the defining features of his books is the\\ncharacterisation and the atmosphere. No one does it better. This leads\\nto his books being long and slow some times but that\\'s the part of it.\\nThis normally doesn\\'t transfer well to cinema where everything is cut\\nand compressed. This movie is better than the book. I read the book and\\nI was impressed I saw the movie and I fell in love with it.The movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories\\nenhances their character brilliantly. All what comes before ties in to\\nthe end. One of the greatest effect in the movie along with the\\natmosphere is the soundtrack. It plucks at you, it pulls at you and it\\nlulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it, smiles\\nwith it and cries with it.I wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a\\nstage where we can talk about other features of this movie. There are\\nmany great moments in the movie including the two stage ending, both\\nstages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. Another\\ngreat moment for me is the release of Brooks Hatlen from prison. His\\ndialogue delivery (\\x85the world went ahead and got itself in to one BIG\\nDAMN hurry\\x85) and acting is brilliant at that moment and is perfectly\\ncaptured further ahead in the movie when Red facing similar\\ncircumstances confesses, \"Terrible thing to live in fear\\x85\" The same\\nfear can be glimpsed when Red glances fearfully over a stone wall in\\nBuxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a\\nletter. (Great acting and direction) This movie is about hope and friendship. Those of us who have seen it\\nmany times, enough to even forget the count are touched by it every\\ntime. We now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is\\nimpressed upon our memory because this is art. The message of eternal\\nhope is wonderfully characterised in Andy and that of friendship in\\nRed.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI have this film on DVD and it's one of my favourites. That said, it's\\nbeen several years since I sat down and watched it and I hoped it was\\nstill as good as I remembered. It might be worth pointing out here that\\nI've been a huge Stephen King fan since I was at school, probably a\\ngood 30 years all told. I have every book in general circulation, and\\nI've read a lot of them more than once. Different Seasons must have\\nbeen one of the first books of his that I bought when it first came\\nout, way back in '82 or '83. It's a collection of four unrelated\\nnovellas, other than that each title has a different season mentioned\\nin the subtitle. The first of the novellas is Rita Hayworth and\\nShawshank Redemption: Hope Springs Eternal, and it is, in my opinion,\\nby far the best. If you haven't read it, I would thoroughly recommend\\nit, particularly if you haven't seen the film as the movie stuck pretty\\nclosely to the original story so there won't be many surprises in store\\nfor you otherwise. Incidentally, if you've ever seen Rob Reiner's movie\\nStand by Me or Bryan Singer's Apt Pupil you'll find two of the other\\nstories in the collection pretty familiar too. But I digress, back to\\nthe movie in question.I wasn't disappointed. This is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly\\ndeserves it's place at the top of the list. The performances from Tim\\nRobbins & Morgan Freeman are superb and the friendship between their\\ncharacters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. You see\\nthem, particularly Freeman, get gradually broken and institutionalised\\nas the film plays out. And then, of course, you get that fantastic\\nfeel- good ending that you really wanted, but somehow never actually\\nexpected. But it's not just the performances from Robbins and Freeman\\nthat delight. Both Bob Gunton, the sadistic and greedy warden who\\nsomehow believes he is doing God's work, and Clancy Brown (remember him\\nas the Kurgan in Highlander?) as the equally sadistic, almost\\nsociopathic Captain Hadley, give wonderfully sinister performances.Most of the other prisoners, with the possible exception of James\\nWhitmore's Brooks, are fairly two-dimensional, but then the director\\nalmost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewer's\\nattention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing\\nbond.The film begins in the 1940s, and continues on until the 1960s so it\\nwas essentially a period piece when it was made. This has stopped it\\nbecoming dated in any way. Also, because it's set in a prison which\\nappears almost completely isolated from the outside word, the passage\\nof time is easy to miss. The movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+\\nyears ago when it was first released. At two and quarter hours, it's\\nprobably one of the longer films in the list (although by no means the\\nlongest), but it keeps the viewer's attention for the full duration,\\nand never seems to lose its sense of direction. Every scene pushes the\\nplot forward in some way.A definite 10/10 from me, and thoroughly recommended.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nMovies simply do not get better than this.Inspiring, captivating, intense, funny (at times), tragic (at times).\\nInteresting and thrilling.Every aspect of this movie is perfection: the acting, story, dialog,\\nproduction, setting, cinematography, etc... all perfect.This film is truly flawless.I could not describe this movie as \"fun\" but I would describe it is\\nunparalleled in its excellence- and not in some stupid artsy sense-\\njust plain and simple it is story telling at its finest.If you haven\\'t seen this movie, you absolutely need to watch it right\\nnow.

       " u\"\\nThe first time I watched this film I was on a coach heading to the\\nfrench Alps in year 8 of school. I loved it from the first moment. A\\nfew weeks later when I discovered the title of the film I went out and\\nbrought it, (or more correctly had it brought as I wasn't old enough).\\nIt remains one of my favourite films in my collection.Why do I think this is one of the best films ever, it comes down to the\\ntelling of a great story, in a great way, by great actors. From the\\nmoment the film begins your sucked in, the audience is made to connect\\nwith the events we see on screen thanks to the soulful voice of the\\ngreat Morgan Freeman, he has the ability to help us relate with events\\nand almost forget we are watching a film, but instead listening to a\\nstory from a much loved grandparent. When he speaks the audience\\ndefinitely listens.However Morgan is by no means the star. The less well known but equally\\ntalented Tim Robbins, his performance of Andy Dufresne, is in my\\nopinion one of the all time greats. The way in which the character\\nattempts to retain dignity and his humanity, instead of being twisted\\ninto the archetypal convict is reason enough for this film to be in the\\nIMDb top 250. The way at which Dufresne strives to improve his and the\\nother convicts leaves you with a taste on the honourably of the\\ncharacter, or his rebellious acts toward the Warden just to provide the\\ninmates with a piece of music is a scene which you remember just\\nbecause of its shear brilliance. Which reminds me big thanks to Steven King for writing the book this\\nfilm was based on, you did good, like you normally do.No one could review this film without mentioning James Whiymore who\\nplays the tragic figure of Brookes, the old lovable inmate. The sad\\ntale of the man who had spent his life in prison and dies in freedom is\\nthe emotional heart of the film, I feel sad every time I watch it.\\nJames Whitmore was truly a great actor, this film proves it. Th story never gets tedious no matter how many time you watch it, and\\nif its your first time watching be set for a treat.The best thing I can say about this film is watch it, and the only\\nproblem you'll have is trying to get across to your friends exactly why\\nthe need to see this great piece of cinema\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nYou know it's really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you\\nmight look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i\\nguess it's not avatar where you get CGI things or these 3D animation\\nmovie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill\\nyou with the action. What makes this motion picture special is that you\\nwill grow to love this movie , the first time you walk out of threatre\\nyou may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made , but there's\\nsomething about it which makes you see it again and again and each time\\nyou see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by\\nthese great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch\\nit a hundred times literally. Count my words you will watch this movie\\nthat many times. It's a story about hope as many people have already\\nsaid in the review also about friendship and almost all these great\\nhuman emotions. Great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a\\ncherry on the cake.The movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes\\nyou angry, yet it's not a depressing movie like schindler's list or a\\nfairy tale one like forrest gump , it's just a story which gives you\\nhope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have\\nwatched a lot of movies and this IS THE BEST ONE.\\n\",\n",

Mind\\nyou, this movie comes very very close to a 10.I knew nothing of the movie before watching it and was picking my jaw\\nup off the floor upon completion. The amount of situations and\\nexperiences I could relate to and empathize with was incredible. The\\nsimplicity of the message within the complication of human interaction\\nand misunderstanding. It was a shocker. The extent of rawness people\\ncan portray towards each other versus the compassion was wound together\\nlike yin and yang. We can't really have one without the other.Since, I have seen this movie several times. Each time, I still find\\nsomething new to ponder if it was intentionally placed, or just happens\\nto fit.I highly recommend this movie to believe in the power of the human\\nspirit and magnitude of motivation brought on by friends.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nIn 1995, when I was fourteen, out of the blue, I saw in a newspaper,\\nthat one of my favorite Stephen King stories, Rita Hayworth and the\\nShawshank Redemption, had finally made its way to the silver screen.It wasn\\'t showing at the Hoyts/Greater Union cinemas, rather a local\\nindependent/art-house cinema. Of course, that didn\\'t bother me so I\\nwent. Over 2hours long, Shawshank swept you into another world. Stephen\\nKing\\'s short-novel was very faithfully adapted. Three pieces of\\nbrilliance stood out then, and still do today. 1 First, the film was brilliantly paced, never a dull moment. Having\\nread the short-novel before hand didn\\'t diminish any expectations. 2 Second a brilliant cast. Sheer brilliance from Morgan Freeman, and\\nTim Robbins, as Red and Andy Dufresne. Very strong supporting cast in\\nBob Gunton - the cruel Warden Sam Norton, other inmates: Gill Bellows\\nas young Tommy Williams, James Whitmore, the elderly Brooks (brilliant\\nexpansion of character, that short novel only dealt with in two\\nparagraphs). Yet the show was stolen by Clancy Brown. Brown\\'s legendary\\nperformance as Captain Bryon Hadley, one guy you clearly didn\\'t want on\\nyour case! 3 Finally what remains in my mind the most, from Red\\'s last\\nparole-hearing, to the end of the film. Words can\\'t simply convey the\\nemotions, this was what I didn\\'t except. It was so powerfully done. My\\nfavorite quote: Andy Dufresne: \"Get busy living, or get busy dying. \"\\nEnough said.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nYou go into a film hoping to be entertained. That's the least you can\\nexpect. If a film manages not only to entertain but also to inspire\\nthen you've really got something. Such is the case with The Shawshank\\nRedemption. Few movies are as inspiring and uplifting as this tale\\nof...an innocent man rotting away in prison? Well that doesn't sound\\nparticularly inspiring. Sounds depressing even. But this movie will\\nsurprise you. At times along the way it is rather bleak, things seem\\nhopeless. But the movie's hero never gives up hope. He is not content\\nto sit in prison and rot. Get busy living or get busy dying. Is there\\never really any doubt which of those options Andy Dufresne will choose?In 1947 Andy, a banker on the outside, is sent to Shawshank State\\nPenitentiary for life after being wrongly convicted of murdering his\\nwife and her lover. He befriends a prisoner named Red, a man popular\\namongst his fellow inmates because Red is the man who can get things.\\nMost of the men want the typical prison contraband. Cigarettes are the\\nbig item. Andy's different. He wants a tiny little rock hammer to\\nmaintain his rock collection. And later he asks for a Rita Hayworth\\nposter. As the years go by Rita becomes Marilyn, Marilyn becomes\\nRaquel. It's as good a way as any to mark the passage of time. Time\\nmarches on. The world moves on. But the men of Shawshank are left\\nbehind. That would be hard enough to take even if you were stone-cold\\nguilty, a menace to society. For an innocent man like Andy Dufresne?\\nYou wonder how he cannot be utterly defeated by life. Yet somehow he\\nmaintains a sense of calm and a great inner strength. There's something\\nabout this guy.What exactly is it about Andy Dufresne? Hard to say because the story\\nis never really told through his eyes but rather through those of his\\nfriend Red. We come to know Andy only to the extent that Red does. And\\nfor this story that setup really works. Tim Robbins is excellent in the\\nrole of Andy, the film's hero figure, but Morgan Freeman has perhaps\\nthe more challenging job in playing Red. Freeman's character serves as\\nthe audience's eyes and ears. And he also serves as the movie's voice.\\nExtensive use of voice-over narration in films can be an iffy\\nproposition, often proving more distracting than helpful. But Freeman's\\nvoice, Red's voice really, narrates this story beautifully. Playing off\\none another wonderfully Robbins and Freeman make a terrific team. This\\nis a movie content to let its two main characters just sit around and\\ntalk. True, there's not much else to do inside those prison walls. But\\nsome of the shared moments between Andy and Red are as poignant as any\\nyou'll see in any film and the two actors deserve their due credit for\\nmaking it so.You wouldn't go so far as to call it slow but the movie certainly\\nproceeds at a deliberate pace. This is a story which takes its time in\\nletting you know where it is ultimately headed. It's essentially Andy's\\nstory, as told by Red. But there is room for some other characters to\\ncarve out their place as well. Most touching is the story of elderly\\nprisoner Brooks, as played beautifully by James Whitmore. His little\\nstory within the story definitely tugs on the heartstrings. Of course\\nfor any movie to truly succeed there has to be some conflict and for\\nthat we have guard Byron Hadley and warden Samuel Norton. At least\\nHadley is upfront in his evilness. Norton's one of film history's\\nbiggest hypocrites, walking around the prison spouting Bible verses all\\nthe while being engaged in all manner of unseemly activities. This is a\\nman who needs a comeuppance. But in the world of Shawshank it is Norton\\nwho has all the power. This is a story seemingly destined for a very\\nunhappy ending. The righteous man does not seem at all likely to\\nprevail. But, slowly but surely, the movie continues to build towards\\nsomething. What that something will be you can't quite be sure. But\\nwhen the moment comes where all is revealed the film's ultimate triumph\\nis secured. For you have seen not only an entertaining and utterly\\ncompelling story. You've seen something which can't help but make you\\nfeel better about life in general. This is a movie to see when you need\\nto have a little of your faith in humanity restored. It may not be, as\\nit is in some places proclaimed to be, the best movie ever made. But is\\nan undeniably excellent movie which has rightfully become rather\\nbeloved by most everyone who sees it.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI\\'ve read a lot of the comments here. I\\'ve never voted for this movie\\nonce, but now I\\'m going to give it what it deserves. And I am going to\\ntry to describe why a lot of Shawshank fans are voting this the best\\nmovie ever.The reasons that this movie is great are: it has incredible acting,\\nincredible story-telling, incredible pace, incredible writing and\\ndialogue, incredible imagery, and an incredible twist and ending.The Godfather also has these qualities.But the reason Shawshank is better is because it literally is\\npotentially life-changing. People watch Shawshank and someone truly may\\nbelieve in HOPE. They may truly believe their lives will get better.\\nThey may truly believe others\\' lives can be made better. Its message is\\nnot only told, but it is FELT and oft times ABSORBED. For men, for\\nwomen, for old, for young, for everyone. It is a masterpiece. What\\nother movie affects people in this way? You don\\'t get that with The\\nGodfather. GF is a great film, but you just come out of it saying,\\n\"Wow, that was one of the best films I\\'ve ever seen.\" With Shawshank,\\nyou say more than that. You feel more than that.You will never see another like it. And the mere perfection of this\\nmovie, by a novice director, will frustrate experienced and future\\ndirectors forever.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI'm a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story.\\nAmerican movies doesn't always provide that.The Shawshank Redemption, however, is a prime example of what American\\nstory telling can be. With a slight non-linear build up, strong and patient character\\ndevelopment, the movie drags you more and more into the despair of Andy\\nDufresne, but always with a sense of hope.For me, there's no two ways about it. This is simply the best movie\\never made.10/10.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\nI came expecting a masterpiece and left with the impression I\\'d seen a\\nrelatively unremarkable film with pretensions of profundity. Put plainly,\\nthe primary message is \"Hope sustains the human spirit in a world of\\nhardship and despair,\" which is a truism that would fit nicely in a\\nfortune\\ncookie. Nonetheless, the power of hope can serve as an affecting theme.\\nPerhaps this common theme is taken by so many as great depth because so\\nmuch\\nof Hollywood\\'s product these days is appallingly shallow or callously\\nbrutal. Apparently, the public is desperate for something to care\\nabout.The direction is somewhat mannered and reminiscent of older films, which\\nin\\nitself is neither good nor bad. But in this case it blends with a\\nstoryline\\nthat seems virtually comprised of movie cliches of prison life. The\\ncharacters are also stereotypes: the evil warden (bible-toting,\\nnaturally!),\\nthe brutal and inhuman prison guard, the gang of prison buddies, the gang\\nof\\ncell block victimizers, the experienced convict who has mastered the\\nsystem\\n(played by Morgan Freeman), the enigmatic newcomer who works subtly to\\nsubvert the system (played by Tim Robbins) -- all the classics on parade,\\nwith few of the unnecessary peculiarities that define real human beings!\\nWe\\'ve seen them all before, and in more realistic guise. These\\none-dimensional characters function with the monomania of gears in a\\nmachine, churning out a largely predictable plot. This is typical of\\nallegorical stories, and I suspect this story can be read as allegory\\n(which\\nis not surprising, since it is based on a Stephen King tale). Regardless,\\nI\\ncan honestly say not one element of the plot caught me by surprise.In all, the film seems to hover in tone and content somewhere between\\nreality and the idealized world of the fable (say, a fable like The Green\\nMile, a movie by the same director). Many of the story elements seemed in\\none way or another contrived, which left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied\\nand\\nmanipulated. Even good devices -- such as the well-known tendency of\\nprisoners to become programmed by prison life, resulting in problems when\\nthey return to society (a syndrome referred to in the film as becoming\\n\"institutionalized\") -- lose some of their power through a rather\\nheavy-handed treatment. However, the climax of the story (although\\npredictable) was very well-constructed and quite effective.Regarding the acting, Tim Robbins is fair, but hardly awe-inspiring. On\\nthe\\nother hand, Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors, is a rare talent\\nwho\\nis almost certain to turn in a superb performance. This movie is no\\nexception, and I believe if viewers think about it, they will realize that\\nthe strongest, most eloquent and moving portion of the movie is the last\\nhalf hour in which his character, Red, is the focus of attention. The\\nextended denouement almost saved the film for me, but for this viewer the\\nmovie reached its end with only a hint of the title\\'s promised\\nredemption.For those of you who want to see a prison movie that is deeper, more\\nprofound, has better dialogue, plotting, and symbolism; and presents\\ncharacters in now familiar roles (your assignment, compare and contrast!)\\nbut with considerably more substance and reality, check out Cool Hand\\nLuke.\\nIt may not spell out what it\\'s all supposed to mean in Shawshank\\'s\\nuser-friendly, large-print narration, but it is nonetheless in all\\nrespects\\nthe superior movie.\\n\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nMany, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical\\nand moving epic, but It's really not all that.  It is a good movie, but it\\nis not great or thought provoking at all.  That year, 1994, was a great year\\nfor movies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet\\npeople think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are \\x91great' movies?  Gag\\nme.Here's some of the problems (Don't read this if you haven't seen the\\nmovie)Morgan Freeman's character - Don't get me wrong Freeman is a great actor\\n(even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch\\nMTV's \\x91Scared Straight' or listened to Chris Rock's stand-up?  Now tell me\\nwhat kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using\\nwords that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster's? \\nFreeman's character's narration also served as a purpose to constantly\\nbludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who've never been to\\nprison come up with.  By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant\\nstream of corny insight I've already heard.  Tell the truth now... If you\\nsaw a murderer on the evening news you'd probably want him dead or at least\\nin prison for life, yet here you're supposed to rejoice in his parole as a\\nresult of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don't-care speech that only seems to come\\nup in movies.  Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman\\ndropping the F, it never sounds right.The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played? \\nHas anyone that evil ever run a prison?  That is classic jail movie\\nmaterial.  Obviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about\\nglorifying criminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil.  How\\nirritating\\x85 If you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and\\nbeing real people; don't try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and\\nClyde or Pulp Fiction, much more interesting.Brooks \\x96 Some serious button pushing here.  Brooks is a typical, lame\\nattempt to draw out some sentiment.  The bird thing is a rip off of Escape\\nfrom Alcatraz and like Freeman's character he's a great guy who happened to\\ncommit an offense so despicable he's in one of the most secure prisons in\\nthe country, but we can forget about that, right?  The `Brooks was here'\\nhanging himself because he can't keep up is another Hollywood favorite.  Who\\nhangs themselves?  My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being\\nhanged because of the shame and disrespect.  Yet, Brooks hung himself when\\nat his age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course.   Or\\nbetter yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death\\non alcohol and mind-altering drugs.   Almost sounds like fun, who would\\nprefer hanging?  You know who, a character in a movie.  That pretty much\\nsums up the Shawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires\\nbecause there is nothing genuine or authentic about it.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is another of those films that inexplicably gets the reputation of\\nbeing the best film ever made and a kind of rabid mass psychosis by\\nsuggestion seems to result. I'm amazed at the number of times this turns up\\nwhenever people do a top ten list. Unfailingly, like the proverbial black\\npenny, up it pops. Yawn. I think kids need to be forcefully tied to a chair\\nand made to watch some film history. Why on earth does every single thing\\nStephen King inflicts on the reading public have to be made into a film?\\nThey'll be making his shopping list next. It would be okay if he was an\\ninteresting author but the majority of what he turns out is handed down pulp\\ndetritus. This film is a staggering three hours long and full of cliched\\nbathetic corn although freeman does his best. Robbins is an average actor\\nand his character is a cypher at best. The plot is very silly. Are they\\nreally trying to tell us that no one would check a very prominent item in a\\ncell for fifteen years? There must have been a lot of noise filtering\\nthrough and a draught which would rattle it like mad. I'm sure that's the\\nfirst place they'd check behind for a marijuana stash. And didn't prisoners\\nget moved around regularly from cell to cell? The come-uppance of the staff\\nwas hugely unlikely too, destroying any poignancy and good will the film may\\nhave stirred up earlier. It was daft stuff. And we mustn't forget the old\\nstalwart of hack directing, the thunderstorm to highten...well, I don't know\\nwhat really, it's hard to see with all that flashing. I suspose it's\\nstirring for some to see a crane shot of a man holding his arms to the\\nheavens. It's a highlight of their lives. I call it film making by numbers.\\nAnd there are a lot of numbers in this film. It's one virtue is it doesn't\\nduck prison rape.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nFilms that invoke volumous comments are either visually sensional,\\nobjects of\\nmedia hype or emotionally stimulating. Shawshank Redemption falls into the\\nlatter category.\\nI saw it for the first time on television, it did not need the wide screen\\nor dramatic visual effects because it had been well-adapted from Stephen\\nKing's book to portray something that has  worried everyone at some time in\\ntheir lives.  Being convicted of a crime that they did not commit and locked\\nup for life with the very worst types of human beings.  How being\\ninstitutionalised is the only way to survive, but when it ends there is no\\nway to go, no way to return to a former life.\\nAll human existence is based on a survival instinct. Once that is destroyed,\\ndeath is a welcome relief.The story hinges around three men,  one who never lost it and escaped to\\nlive again, one who nearly lost it but re-gained hope from the first and one\\nwho lost it and killed himself.\\nAlthough the setting was the harsh and hostile environment of prison, it\\ncould have been any other institution, a hospital, an old peoples home even \\na family home.Andy Dufresne is different because he never lost the hope of escape, he used the\\nweaknesses of others, the corruption of prison officials, the internal\\nprison system to help his long term plan.  He had the great advantage over\\nthe others, including the Prison staff of being , intellignet knowledgable\\nand clever. Such people always win through.  I did not know what the end was\\ngoing to be, a clever piece of filming.  Although the meassage was not lost,It should give encouragement to all those who find themselves in a similar\\nposition. The justice system, although far from perfect is much improved so\\nmiscarriages can now be corrected. But I still wounder what it must feel\\nlike to be in the situation of Andy Dufresne but without his\\nabilities.Let's have more such films that provoke the senses and emotions as this one\\ndid.  I make no excuse in adding to the hundreds of comments already make on\\nthis film , although I have not read them because I wanted mine to be\\noriginal. But no doubt other thinking people would have made similar\\ncomments.  I hope that writers, producers and sponsors read these comments\\nand take note when making more such films\\n\\n\",\n",

The movie is a beautiful story about hope that holds you\\nabove the surface even when your life seems meaningless. Morgan Freeman and\\nTim Robins are magnificent, and this film I can recommend to\\nanyone.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThe key scene in The Shawshank Redemption comes when Red is confronted by\\nAndy Dufresne with the fact that he has given up hope.  \"Hope is a dangerous\\nthing,\" says Red, and we understand, after the trials he has been through,\\nwhy he can say this and believe it.  And because this is such a well-crafted\\nfilm, we can also see why Andy refuses to accept this philosophy, because by\\nthis time we have come to know them both so well.\\nThe movie follows the lives of these two men, who have come to Shawshank\\nPrison at different times in their lives, as very different people. Red has\\nbeen there long enough, denied parole enough times that he no longer waits\\nfor the day he will be released, but for the days he makes his pickup at the\\nlaundromat for the goods he sells to the inmates.  Andy was a wealthy banker\\non the outside, who is sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover in\\na nightmarish trial, the kind where every shred of evidence points to\\nculpability.  The movie casts doubt on his guilt long before it reveals what\\nactually happened.  In prison he faces beatings, rape and oppression, but\\nthere is some kind of redemption here, too; as the film\\'s title suggests,\\nthis is not a joyless foray into prison life but a story about the way two\\ndifferent men cope with the day to day routine of incarceration, and what\\nfollows beyond it.\\nWhat amazed me, watching the movie, is the the filmmakers have pulled of\\nthe tricky job of taking this material that could have been cloying and made\\nit plausible, even meaningful.  It is worth seeing just as a statement about\\nhow the choices we make in life are more important than what happens to\\nus.\\n',\n",

I believe\\nthat the reason the movie is so popular is because of the huge wave of\\npopularity towards voting it up. As the movie portrays the continuous\\nstruggle for the main character, Andy Dufresne, you are in suspense,\\nand locked by the question whether he did it or not. And even though he\\nkeeps doing good and honorable thing for the guards and his fellow\\ninmates. There was in my experience not a moment before he escaped\\nwhere you are absolutely certain that he did not do it. This is the\\nthing that captivates a lot of people i think, and i follow this\\naspect, and i understand it.

However, it displays what i see\\nas typical for King's work. When he's writing science fiction, fantasy\\nor horror it all sits well. But when he writes anything that should\\nmirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton\\nshirt and the one made of synthetics feels different.

Slowly it has become one of\\nthe most popular movies of all time - and, for some, it has even been\\nlife- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside\\na prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our\\nfeelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us\\nvicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\"\\nslows down and looks.

It was the highest\\nranked movie on IMDb, and of course I would give it a go. The beginning\\nwas very interesting, with Andy being convicted of double homicide and\\nseeing the lean-back of what happened. Him being found guilty, serving\\ntwo life sentences in the toughest prison in America, Shawshank. I\\nthought it would be another overrated boring movie like The Godfather,\\nbut no, it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either.\\nThe dramatic scenes, it gives you a glance of how it is in prison, the\\nemotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece, there is a reason to why it\\nis the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The\\namazing acting, plot and moderate length. The last scene, with \"Red\"\\nwalking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in, it\\nmakes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can\\nsometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie, which Shawshank\\nis. It definitely deserves the spot as #1, I cannot understand how it\\ndidn\\'t win an Oscar.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend, but\\nget a load of potato chips and soda, since you will finish it all up\\nvery fast.\\n',\n",

But,\\nwhen my science teacher told me I should see it, \"because it\\'s a movie\\nwhere you just go, \\'wow\\'\". I did and I was literally in tears by the\\nend. Not in tears of sadness, but tears of joy. Because the film was\\nsimply so beautiful. Not very many films have made me cry. Of course, I\\ncried at the endings of Marley and Me, and Toy Story 3. But there are\\nonly 3 films I\\'ve ever cried at. Some people say Citizen Kane or The\\nGodfather are the best movies ever. FALSE. They are overrated. This\\nfilm is a diamond in the rough. Most people are stubborn and won\\'t even\\ntake this gem into consideration. It truly is the best movie ever. The\\nmusic, the direction, the cast. I won\\'t give anything away, you need to\\nsee the film to appreciate its true beauty, but I will say that the\\nmusic in this film puts John Williams to shame, and the movie reminds\\nus that even in the most bleak of situations, life can still be great.\\nIt is a great movie because it reminds us that hope is something that\\nnothing can quench.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250\\nlist. I don\\'t particularly agree with that, but it is a truly great\\nmovie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling, and it touches the\\nheart and soul.The story is set in the 1940s, and it involves Andy Dufrense (Tim\\nRobbins), a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her\\nlover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would\\nexpect, he is very unhappy at first, but then he leans that there\\'s\\nsomething deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story\\nunfolds, over the years, Andy eventually becomes very influential\\nwithin the prison and gains the respect of other inmates, especially\\n\"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), with whom he develops a special friendship.The story isn\\'t original or creative, and it\\'s relatively simple, and a\\nbit predictable, but it\\'s compelling, moving, and memorable, and\\nthere\\'s a bit more to it which I won\\'t go into. The movie puts the\\nviewer right into the footsteps, experiences, and emotions of the\\ncharacters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances.\\nThey really bring out their characters and offer true depth and\\nemotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person\\nmay be imprisoned, even for life, but the spirit can never truly be\\nimprisoned. The movie conveys this moral message very strongly, and it\\ntruly touches the heart and soul.I am very glad I watched this movie. It is a truly emotional\\nexperience.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe best movie ever made, period.

I'm really disappointed that the actors didn't have enough\\nrecognition for their performances! Actually, the overall movie was\\nunderestimate, by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is\\nan art, powerful and heart full art. See this movie, you'll now what\\nI'm talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems\\nbut, I can't. This movie is touching, sad, beautiful, powerful and\\nperfect. By the way, f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and\\ndo for Forrest Gump for the trophies,but it's just trophies... Still a\\nshame that they decided that.11 out of ten, totally deserves it.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis film is about hope, friendship and redemption. It has solid\\nperformances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton (the\\nwarden). Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this\\nfilm. You experience everything through him; friendship, despair, hope,\\nredemption and happiness. The musical score is nothing short of\\nfantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the\\nfilm.Firstly, this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and\\nis sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on\\nat arrival because of his quiet, unassuming nature. But as time passes,\\nthe other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesn\\'t allow prison\\nto break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off\\non the others. I think to really get this film, you need to step away\\nfrom the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the\\nprison is life. The warden and the guards are problems, trials and\\ntroubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad\\nthings yet, no matter what brutal things you have to endure, you\\'ve\\ngotta hold out hope, you gotta hang on, you have to believe you\\'re\\ngonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human\\nspirit, told in a very simple, straight forward way.This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood\\nseems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful, male friendship and\\njust resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great\\njob of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel\\nstories. The first was the old librarian, Brooks. When he was released,\\nhe struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says, he had become\\ninstitutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone,\\nafraid and had no purpose. In the end, it was just too much for him to\\nbear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film, gets me\\nevery time. When Red is released, he faces the exact same challenges\\nthat Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only\\nthing that kept him him going, was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman\\nnarrates:\"There\\'s a harsh truth to face. No way I\\'m gonna make it on the\\noutside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe\\nthey\\'d send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen\\nknew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things\\nmake sense. Where I won\\'t have to be afraid all the time. Only one\\nthing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.\"It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part\\nof the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison, you\\ncould see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the\\nheartbreak of it was written all over Freeman\\'s face, fantastic acting\\nif you ask me; it was subtle, quiet suffering.And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the\\nredemption is Andy\\'s. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of\\nRed\\'s redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much\\nredesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the\\ncards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise; he\\nhad given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing,\\nRed was just going through the motions, he was just saying what he\\nthought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere.You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. There\\'s a great\\nscene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets\\nhim one as a present and later, in a small but important scene, Red\\npicks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is\\nwhere Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last\\nparole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy, that for the first\\ntime he has a genuine moment of repentance, where he honestly admits to\\nhis crime:\"There\\'s not a day goes by I don\\'t feel regret. Not because I\\'m in\\nhere, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then:\\na young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk\\nto him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way\\nthings are. But I can\\'t. That kid\\'s long gone and this old man is all\\nthat\\'s left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It\\'s just a\\nbullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop\\nwasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don\\'t give a bleep.\"It really is just an incredible, moving scene, one of my all time\\nfavorites. Red is completely broken and regretful, it\\'s nothing short\\nof movie magic. And the ending? Well, let\\'s just say it leaves me with\\na smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made.\\nAn incredibly powerful, uplifting story. If you haven\\'t seen this, you\\nneed to.http://andretms.blogspot.ca/\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nTo be brief, as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life,\\nShawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot, the\\nway it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and\\nthe ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't\\nsee it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a\\ngreat movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have\\nalways found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel.

       " u'\\nThis review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my\\nreview.Sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didn\\'t go well in the box\\noffice. Shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man\\nescapes from a jail. It captures the life of people who spend their\\nlife in jail. I believe that jail life and free life are almost\\nsimilar. Sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live\\nin jail or not. Sometimes life doesn\\'t make any sense at all. Some\\npeople succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great\\ndeal of hardship and still won\\'t succeed in their life. These people\\nare forced to the point of desperation. What they should know is that\\nall of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the\\nmost is \"hope\" which you should need until the moment you die. If you\\nbelieve in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your\\ndestiny in this life or in your after life.This film has really changed\\nmy way of looking the life.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nWell as the other more than 2000 review say it, in my opinion this is\\nthe best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get\\npunched in a face time to time, but you have to stand up, keep your\\nhope and give value to your fellows, because in return life takes care\\nabout your reward. Oh yes, and if you face any evil that you can stop,\\ndo it. This is the message of the film, if we follow it, life may be as\\nrewarding ultimately for us as for the hero.

       " u\"\\nStephen King's novella is a damn good yarn. The narrative is always\\nengrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed\\nwithout exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out\\nas they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something\\nspecial. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification,\\npart of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red\\nwas always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it\\nwithout seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the\\ndirection.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's\\nguilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of\\ninjustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and\\nothers) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the\\nthree quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then\\nthe story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films\\nI have ever seen.\\n\",\n",

I replied back 'for me its rocky',\\nhe asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not, the only\\nanswer he had was it..watch it and then compare it. Now in 2009 with the recession going on, lots of trouble in work and\\ntensions of home and personal life for me. While changing channels, I\\nchanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten\\nminutes. I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. The only\\nreaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close\\nfriends. It was a shaking experience, and I got my answer....I needed to get out\\nof my jail. I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review, few had seen it\\nalready and many did not. Result, more people watched it...and guess\\nwhat I for the first time rated in this website for the movie. ..AND i expect some of my friends also did it.

Its a\\nclassic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Don\\'t think! Just watch &\\nsavour it.I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to\\nmine, I agree 100% to everything of the following: \"Many people in this\\nworld are unhappy. Most people in this world don\\'t want to be unhappy.\\nLots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to\\nwave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and\\nfor all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state,\\nwhile they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they\\'re\\nwatching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people\\nhave learned that the magic wand doesn\\'t exist. They\\'re not destined to\\njoin the bluebirds and fairy tales don\\'t come true. It\\'s not that no\\none lives happily ever after, it\\'s just that they\\'re not going to.\\nThey\\'re busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this\\nfairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense\\nimitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it\\nabout the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the\\ncinematography, the script, the direction or the score. It\\'s about Red.\\nHe is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he\\'s not only\\ntrapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever\\nleaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle\\nwould ever happen to him, he couldn\\'t cope. He\\'s safe in his\\nunhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red\\nsay, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear\\nto me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A\\nlarge proportion of those don\\'t understand what\\'s wrong, but they\\ncertainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully\\nuntouched by this illness definitely don\\'t understand what\\'s going on\\nin those who do. They\\'re too busy living.\"Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film;\\nBelieve me this film is made for multiple viewings...Don\\'t hate this\\nafter viewing it once or twice, give it at least more than 2 viewings\\nbefore you make up your mind. I\\'m POSITIVE it will become more and more\\nbetter after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If\\nnot, maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies\\neveryone and I really don\\'t care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside\\nTop250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above\\nit in the rankings!Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance\\nof HOPE.9.8/10P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest\\nmovie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars\\n4,etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and\\na movie to savour for ages.\\n',\n",

The story then follows the 2 and how they\\nhandle prison life.Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will\\ncommit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly\\ninspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up\\nhoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of\\nthe greatest in film history.Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of\\nall time.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis movie is poetry. For those of you who\\'ve ever felt the way poetry\\nrolls off of the tongue, you\\'ll understand what I mean when I say this.The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freeman\\'s ability\\nto narrate the way he does. His soft, yet ruff voice provides the\\naudience with the belief that this man has endured many years of\\nhardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error.\\nHe is a natural story teller, so his ability as a narrator is natural\\nand smooth; not forced, like so many other actors.Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the\\naudience with an intense amount of emotion, which seems to resonate in\\nhis eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a\\nfascinating thing to watch unfold, as the story lays itself out, like a\\nposter of Rita Hayworth.To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because\\nthis movie makes the audience want to live, love, experience life for\\nall of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple\\nthings and slow down a bit, to admire that which we pass a hundred\\ntimes a day, but never truly see.To describe this movie as \"great\" would be an understatement because it\\nis so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic, it\\nportrays humanity at our best and our worst, providing the audience\\nwith a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the\\ncredits roll, we\\'re left speechless...and at the same time, wanting to\\nshare this masterpiece with those we love and cherish.Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us\\nappreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could\\ncapture humanity this way? I guess a picture really is worth a thousand\\nwords......\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThis is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. I am a Morgan\\nFreeman fan and apart from Driving Miss Daisy, i have loved all his\\nmovies that i have seen. The Shawshank Redemption stands above all. I\\nthink it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just\\nending. The only other prison movie i like as much is the classic Clint\\nEastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz. The Shawshank Redemption has long\\nbeen my favourite movie and even though i have the DVD, i still watch\\nwhen it is on TV. 15 years since its release and i still haven't seen\\nanything i like more. I would recommend this movie to everyone and if\\nyou haven't seen it yet, you must be living in a cave or something. If\\nyou are in a cave, get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nWhen Shawshank begins, for about the first two minutes it seems nothing\\nmore than a made-for-TV movie. However, as the story progresses you\\nfind out how amazing it really is. Yet how can a film that contains\\nrape, beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end? Frank\\nDarabont manages to do this so well. The Green Mile gives you a warm\\nfeeling at the ending, but not like this does. I just love the way it\\nfollows the subplot of Brooks right up until he kills himself. How\\ntouching that was to see an old man, let out of prison but without\\nroutine. He belonged in prison, not in the outside world.You forget at times that you are watching a movie. It sucks you in and\\nmoves you. If you haven't seen Shawshank you have missed out on one of\\nthe finest movies ever made. But don't worry - you're not beyond\\nredemption! Watch it!\\n\",\n",

The story was gripping and\\nI especially liked the pacing, with the story moving along at a quick\\npace, covering years in a matter of minutes. The film was quite gritty\\nand realistic throughout but started losing that quality as it started\\nfeeling more like a fairy tale towards the end.Although the story was initially focused on Andy, it later became quite\\napparent that Red was the true protagonist, who Morgan Freeman\\nportrayed in one of his best performances to date. I believe Morgan\\nFreeman deserved an Oscar for his performance, although he lost it to\\nTom Hanks, who gave an equally great performance in Forrest Gump that\\nsame year.Although I disagree with The Shawshank Redemption's ranking at #1 on\\nthe IMDb Top 250, I believe it is worthy enough to at least be among\\nthe top 100 films. If I had to sum up the film in one sentence, I would\\nsay it is a very gripping and uplifting film to watch.8/10\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI\\'ll admit, I\\'d held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained\\na little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and\\nparticularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching\\nthis film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how\\nbeautiful and amazing this film is.The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the\\nstory of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which\\nhe did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis \"Red\" Redding (played by Morgan\\nFreeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace,\\naccepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the\\nlasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an\\ninteresting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest\\nto become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and,\\nas shown later in the film, breaking out of ShawshankThe acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman,\\nproviding both a character and the narration of said character,\\nportrays his character in such a convincing way that one can\\'t help but\\nfeel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an\\nimmensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant\\nperformance that I couldn\\'t help but feel pure anger for the Warden\\nthroughout the movie.But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying\\nmessages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy\\nmaintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of\\nit. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message\\nthat not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can\\noutlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud\\nto admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout\\nthe film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits\\nsuicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie. It will most\\ncertainly change your life. It did mine.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between\\n1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is\\nwrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to\\nlife imprisonment. (\"Shawshank\" is the name of the prison where he\\nserves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is\\nfrequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual\\ninmates called \"The Sisters\". Two things, however, help him to survive.\\nOne is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation\\nfor being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle\\nit into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts\\nto good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards\\nand even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is\\ngiven a privileged job in the prison library and protection from\\nmolestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the\\n\"Sisters\" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for\\nlife; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on\\nlocal construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to\\nprepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is\\nexploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using\\nAndy\\'s financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems\\nto work to Andy\\'s advantage, because of the extra privileges he is\\ngranted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy\\nWilliams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure\\nAndy\\'s release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to\\nhim that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy\\nconfides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal\\nschemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have\\nTommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes\\nof \"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\", \"Cool Hand Luke\", \"Brubaker\"\\nand the more recent \"The Last Castle\". (Frank Darabont was later to\\ndirect another prison film, \"The Green Mile\", based, like \"The\\nShawshank Redemption\" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made\\nwith a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison\\nconditions and thereby inspire their reform. \"The Shawshank Redemption\"\\nfalls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a\\nbasically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison\\nlife, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades\\nin the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers\\'\\nsole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of\\nfreedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word \"prison\", from the French \"pris\" (\"taken\"), merely indicates a\\nplace where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in\\nAmerica, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term\\nsuch as \"penitentiary\" or \"reformatory\" which implies their purpose of\\nrehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and\\nguards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the\\nopposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out\\nguilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his\\ninvolvement in the Warden\\'s dishonesty, Andy retains a certain\\nintegrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to\\nbe beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort\\nof freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a\\nMozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a\\nreminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so\\ninstitutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as\\nhappened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly\\nafter his release. In prison, his role as the \"fixer\" who can obtain\\nanything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of\\nRita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two\\nitems will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will\\nbe just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job.\\nParadoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside.\\nI won\\'t give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red\\'s\\nprevious kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of\\nthe word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has\\nsince acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American\\ncinema; it has now supplanted \"The Godfather\" as number one on IMDb\\'s\\nTop 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal\\nlist, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250,\\nperhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan\\nFreeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may\\nhave had something to do with its rather clumsy title. \"Shawshank\" is\\nnot a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to\\none story Darabont was once asked how his \"rickshaw\" film was going)\\nand \"redemption\", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a\\nreligious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film;\\nindeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious,\\nBible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion.\\nNevertheless, the word \"redemption\" is perhaps appropriate in this\\ncontext, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to\\nfind a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that\\naccounts for the film\\'s continuing popularity. 9/10\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. I\\nthink that if it had been released with more fanfare and didn't have\\nsuch great competition that year, it might have won for Best Picture.\\nThis film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of it's own\\napart from the cast, score, cinematography, etc., all of which are\\ndeservedly great. This is one of those movies that you can switch to\\nwhen you are channel surfing, and stop and watch the rest of it, no\\nmatter what part of the movie you are at. Perhaps The Godfather and\\nJaws are a couple of others that do that for me, and it never gets old,\\nno matter how many times you watch it. One thing that disappoints me\\nregarding this film is what has happened to the director, Frank\\nDarabont. Unfortunately, he has never come close to achieving the\\ngreatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films. I thought The Green\\nMile was good, but it didn't hold a candle to Shawshank. I was also\\nvery disappointed in The Mist. I sincerely hope that he is able to\\nrecapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film,\\nbecause he definitely does have the proved ability to do so.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nIn short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a\\nsecond \\u2013or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first\\nviewing. The other night, overpowered by feelings of despondency and\\nennui, I went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an\\nimpulse I picked up The Shawshank Redemption. I savored every moment of\\nthe movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. I chalk\\nit up to its beautifully crafted story, its virtuoso and powerhouse\\nperformances, and its underlying themes of hope, resolve, and ultimate\\nsalvation. This time, in his feature directorial debut Frank Darabont\\nhas tapped into the wellspring of King the horrible's and fashioned a\\njuggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella Rita Hayworth and the\\nshawshank Redemption. This movie stands out among other prison flicks\\nin that it flies in the face of conventions. Contrary to our\\nexpectations and cheapened tastes, Shawshank does not intend to explore\\nthe horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants\\nclutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from\\nthe shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration\\nagainst all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. And the movie\\npulls it off big time. Among a mosaic of characters, events,\\nshenanigans and skullduggery, the movie mainly delves into the\\nfriendship struck up between two lifers. The friendship between Andy\\nDufresne, played convincingly by Tim Robbins, who is accused of\\nmurdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent\\nlives, and the veteran Red, the brilliant Morgan Freeman, carries the\\nemotional and inspirational mood of the movie. When a busload of\\nprisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of Shawshank,\\nthe other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first\\nnight of prison life. Red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh\\nfish Andy, who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a\\nfish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. Red loses\\nsince Andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any\\nprison wall several feet thick. Little do the fellow prisoners realize\\nat first glance what an enigmatic character he is. For the first months\\nhe says next to nothing, meanders through other prisoners in the prison\\nyard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn\\nhumorous, poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient\\nRed who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for\\nthe services he provides. However, Red's omniscience is not\\nall-encompassing and Godly enough to bore into the Sphinx-like mind of\\nthe introverted Andy even after 19 years. On a tarring occasion, he\\noverhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an\\ninheritance, he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on\\ntax evasion. Now, he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the\\nbooks for the prisons' powers that be who have hit pay dirt. His\\nfinancial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. Now he is the\\nvictim of his own success. A newcomer is willing to testify to his\\ninnocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too\\nvaluable to be expendable. Andy survives several assaults and rapes. He\\nnever gives up. He never cracks under pressure. Life is very simple to\\nhim: get busy living or get busy dying. He makes the first choice and\\nremains true to it through thick and thin. He lives with hope as his\\nsource of salvation. The emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal\\nto the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members.\\nMorgan Freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man.\\nTim Robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and\\ninspiration. James Whitmore, as the institutionalized prison trusty who\\nis suicidal in the outside, turns in a superlative performance. Hats\\noff to all the performers. The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example\\nof the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its\\npopularity. This movie famously bombed in the box office, barely\\ncovering its budget. But overtime it gained in such popularity that it\\nhas snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in IMDb from such hot\\nfavorites and topdogs like Godfather, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction,\\nthe last two of which eclipsed Shawshank in 1994 Academy Awards.\\nPerhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is\\nenjoying now. All in all, Shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie\\nwith bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on\\nnext occasions.\\n\",\n",

It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale\\nof recognition it deserved, but being on the IMDb top 250 movies of all\\ntime based on people's votes is a great way to show the well earned\\nappreciation.If you did not watch this movie yet, then you missed a lot!\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nEvery time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that\\nit is my favorite movie of all time.

First and foremost, if it sets out to\\nentertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly\\ndoes that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation\\nin its inclusion in the great IMDb \"greatest movie\" debate. The serious\\nnature of its central plot points\\x97a wrongly convicted murderer who\\nassists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escape\\x97is\\ncontrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy,\\nthe splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There\\'s nothing\\nfancy about this film\\x97no special effects, spectacular scenery or even a\\nbunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly\\nthrough the narration of Morgan Freeman\\'s character, Red, that almost\\nlulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or\\nimportant is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot\\ntwists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I\\'m\\nactually sharing in Andy\\'s redemption. Now if that isn\\'t what they\\nteach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom.Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the\\n\"greatest film of all time\" because as art, and in an art form as\\nvaried as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual.\\nGreatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this\\nbeholder\\'s eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest\\nfilm I have ever seen.\\n',\n",

Frank Darabont\\ndidn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to\\nlove this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.

       " u'\\nI have seen this movie a few times. Each time with the same hope and\\nenthusiasm as before. The main story is obviously Andy\\'s.

It\\'s a tale of society, men trying to\\nsurvive trying to remain human and civilized. Red is a gentleman\\nmasterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. His character\\nadds depth to the story and makes room for hope, for friendship. All\\nthose around Andy benefit from his morals, his intelligence, his\\nperseverance, his will not to let go of himself. At first we see men\\nwith no hope, no way out of their walls. Brooks is an unfortunate part\\nof it. But Andy changes lives. Some study, some begin to plan life\\noutside the walls. Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as\\nthey come. Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first\\ntime I saw it without actually knowing what it was, what it is... It\\'s\\nonly fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people\\nwatch it, it\\'s just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again\\nand again.

       " u\"\\nDespite being a very long movie, and not very action packed for that\\nmatter, I found 'The Shawshank Redemption' one of the most entertaining\\nmotion pictures I have ever stumbled upon. And I think that the\\nentertainment value a certain film may hold is largely over-looked\\namong film critics, and most people who watch films with a critical\\neye. But I hold it as probably the single most important feature in\\nmovies in most cases. And by entertainment value I do not only mean how\\nit feels when you are watching the movie, but also the picture it\\nleaves on your mind that makes you want to see it again, and that you\\ncan look back at and actually experience the feeling you gain from\\nactually watching the film. And this is where 'Shawshank' really\\nshines. The 2 hours just went by, and left me with a really good\\nfeeling after wards for some time.But the other features should not be ignored either in any case. I\\nreally like the way 'Shawshank' makes you think. For me, it was mostly\\nabout how good I actually have it, and about life in general.

Its message of hope and, above\\nall, perseverance, kept me going through many of life\\'s travails. I\\nthink I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life\\n(albeit in dramatic fashion)and even the stress of boredom. The other\\nthing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another\\nwithout even saying much to them. After all, Andy and Red only have one\\ntrue baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together (One of the\\ngreatest scenes in the history of movies, by the way).

       " u\"\\nWhy Shawshank Redemption isn't rated 9.9/10 is beyond me.What has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small\\nthings...99.9% of movies miss them. A movie is a photographic montage\\nof images with sound and is meant to represent a story. Humans have\\nalways enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in\\ncaves to modern things like FaceBook or YouTube, it's all about\\nstories.Shawshank has many small instances that Frank Darabont included like\\nwhen Red leaves a small note to Andy with a free poster when he returns\\nfrom the hospital/isolation. Another small instance is when Andy gives\\nRed the harmonica, it could easily not have been filmed but it touches\\neveryone with its deeper meanings. It's a collage of many small\\ninstances that make it meaningful and memorable, over and over again.I am convinced that's why everyone loves this movie and watch it\\nrepeatedly, it's the small things that touch you. How many movies have\\ngiven you the most important small message of all...of hope...it's the\\nmost powerful of goals we can have, hope really sets you free.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nI'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a\\ngood adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others\\nhave not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an\\namazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with\\nthe inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is\\nwonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some\\nidea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an\\nairline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any\\nother headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching\\nit--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do\\nyourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!!\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nDon\\'t know how many will ever see the 2,086th comment in this site -\\nbut just saw a friend\\'s DVD of this film, again. I had missed it due to\\nbeing in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run,\\nand caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely\\nsometime following.This was the third or fourth time I\\'d seen it straight through, and it\\nis one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better -\\non successive viewings.Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in\\nlarger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single\\nexception.My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and\\nwidely-expert expert in this area. But he\\'s so immersed in this realm,\\nthat whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or\\nkeyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he\\nhad bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn\\'t\\nfeel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans\\nwith the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a\\nmessenger of the warden\\'s) the way the film depicted -- whereas today,\\nif such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more\\npossible.I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the\\nstory, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a\\nformer whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more\\neffectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the\\nfirewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both\\ntremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as\\nTim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the\\nlike were the governing elements.This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and\\nits very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done\\nmany sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances\\nportraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and\\n\"nasty-nice\" elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor,\\noften even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as\\nwell as humanly possible, with his performance in this roleThis is a film for which the term \"perfect piece of entertainment\" does\\nnot exaggerate.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nShawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong, firm and amazing story\\nthat can move people while sitting down to watch it. The characters are\\nmemorable. Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head. Tim Robbins\\nand Any Dufrense, is amazing as well. Shawshank gives the audience a\\ntaste of a perfect movie. Movies like this don't come often. Movies\\ncome with strong stories, but acting, and flow of this story can mess\\nit up. Shawshank doesn't disappoint. The acting is superb, and the flow\\nof the story is unforgettable. Based on the Stephen King novel, Rita\\nHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, I'd say this is one of the\\nmovies where the film triumphs over the novel. The film also brings a\\nsense of humor, which is a very good tool for films like these, because\\nif everything is serious, it's very possible that it might be killed.\\nWell, people have their own opinion. One scene amazes me, and probably\\nis one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are\\nwatching Gilda, and they're all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the\\nthing with her hair. It still makes me laugh and pleased, with the\\nacting and reactions of the prisoner, and the beauty of Rita Hayworth\\nherself. Shawshank Redemption is a one-of-a-kind film, where stories\\ncome in, and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new\\nlevel. The excellent acting, and a great adapted screenplay makes this\\nmovie one of the greatest films ever in history.\\n\",\n",

Great performances (Tim Robbins & Freeman\\nQualifying as one my favorite actors). The whole presentation has been\\nvery apt to the movie.

       " u\"\\nWhen you look at IMDb's top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films\\nlike Star Wars, The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings and others. Not\\nsaying that these movies are bad (they are actually quite brilliant)\\nthey were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these\\nfilms had in the time. Star Wars started the sci-fi age, The Godfather\\nmade people interested in the secret society of the Mafia and Lord of\\nthe Rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. But what really\\nmade these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic\\nspecial effects which costed certain amounts of money. In 1994 Frank\\nDarabont decided to have a go on one of Stephen King's novels, not\\nknowing what would happen. They made a film that is honest and that\\ncontains (on the contrary to Star Wars etc.) a vital lesson, a meaning\\nand a message to all who watch it.This movie is redefining cinema. No explosions. No heart-stopping\\nexcitement. No, it's pure poetry, music and sublime acting. The\\noverwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker Andy Dufresne\\n(played by Tim Robbins) who was falsely convicted for a double life\\nsentence in the heavily guarded establishment of Shawshank Prison. His\\nlife must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like Red\\n(wonderfully acted out by Morgan Freeman) and Brooks Hatlen (James\\nWhitmore brings tears to your eyes). Warden Norton (played immensely\\nevil by Bob Gunton) and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) don't make Andy's\\nlife comfortable in the prison, but with Andy's unique skills he\\nmanages to win their attention and gratitude.This film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the\\nShawshank Prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where Andy locks\\nhimself up in the Warden's office and plays Mozart to all the inmates.\\nMorgan Freeman's raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any\\nother moment in any other movie I ever saw. At the release of the film,\\npeople criticised the film harshly and wasn't a big hit, certainly not\\nat the box-office. But when the film appeared in the stores it became\\nan enormous hit. And until this day, for over 4-5 years now I believe,\\nit stands on the second place in the top 250, one place away from The\\nGodfather.This is a film you have to see once in your life!\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nI was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a\\nfew movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is \\'The\\nShawshank Redemption\\'. I had always wondered why it had such good\\nratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250, and I\\nthought I would see just how good the movie really was.When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded, I\\nsat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my\\ngirlfriend asked me what was wrong, I simply just said \"That....is the\\ngreatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life.\" It was not just an\\nordinary and clich\\xe9d film I was watching, it was art on the screen, 2\\nand a half hours of extraordinary cinematography, unforgettable acting,\\nand a plot so compelling, that you just did not want it to end. Morgan\\nFreeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for\\ntheir respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually\\nsatisfying, while the corruption by the warden and the guards is\\ndreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike\\nsome movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just\\ndragging on, but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to\\nthe screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered\\nin the entire film.\\'The Shawshank Redemption\\' is unique in its own little way, and it has\\naffirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible\\nand rewarding. Not many movies are made like this, and I just hope that\\nthere is a movie like, but probably not as good as, \\'The Shawshank\\nRedemption\\' that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century.\\nMovies like this really change lives.10/10\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nI myself, like most people, love this movie and whenever it got to the\\nend where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it\\nalways sent chills through my soul, but I realized that in addition to\\nthat sequence, where not a word is spoken between the two men, it's\\nthat 'deep blue ocean' that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with\\nthe exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a\\nlittle sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of\\nprison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN\\nhit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the\\nfact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL\\nthings.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nAndy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison\\ndue to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan\\nFreeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship\\nof all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and\\nguides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his\\nloyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and\\nhis moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part\\nof a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone,\\nweak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness\\nof the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told\\nto us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and\\nthe hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has\\na very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its\\nwonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their\\npsychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely\\neverything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of\\nevery time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot.\\nThe one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in\\nthe director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment,\\nAndy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very\\nold and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as\\nhe cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the\\nhardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the\\nend there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is\\nthat, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nUndoubtedly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The\\noutstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me with\\nfeelings so profound of being in that prison with them. Be warned that\\nthe first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting.The film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst\\ndelivering some very powerful social commentary. I am left questioning\\nthe state of our justice system. We lock away these \"threats to\\nsociety\", alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and\\nunnatural of environments. Then when they have served their life terms,\\nwe throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live\\nnormally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their\\nfilthy prison cells. The Shawshank Redemption tells a very powerful\\nstory. A story that made me laugh and cry. It ignited just about every\\nhuman emotion I could possibly experience in just over a two hour\\nperiod of time.A truly amazing film, 10 out of 10 from me!\\n',\n",

This film definitely beat out\\n\"Million Dollar Baby\" for which he ultimately and finally received his\\nfirst Oscar. The Academy wasn\\'t all there when \"Shawshank\" deserved its\\ndue. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job\\nhowever Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of\\ntwo people in horrible circumstances.

       " u'\\nYou\\'d certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. Not\\nbecause it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable\\nviolence (kids are used to that nowadays) but very much so because of\\nthe psychological impact it could have. Forget horror ... if I was a\\nkid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of\\nhumanity, given I would understand it. Once beyond that certain age\\nthis movie will impress you, to say the least.Shawshank Redemption places a man in the wrong place, at the wrong time\\n(early 1900\\'s) and in the worst kind of scenario. He\\'s convicted of the\\nmurder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is how the\\nmovie starts. From this point on the majority of the scenes will take\\nplace in the Shawshank Prison Facility.Logicly, as a viewer, you side for the Andy Dufresne (beautifly\\ninterpreted by Tim Robbins). It doesn\\'t really matter whether you think\\nhe did it or not ... he\\'s stuck in there and it looks like he\\'ll be\\nthere for a while. Friendships are born and enemies are made, as you\\nwould expect. The way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline\\ndescribing the friendships, however, is stunning. At the receiving end\\nof one of those friendships is \\'Red\\' Redding (Morgen Freeman), a fellow\\ninmate. \\'Red\\' can get you anything and as Andy, \\'Red\\' is serving a life\\nsentence. Let\\'s just say they have the time to get to know each other,\\nlearn from each other and eventually save each other.Because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets\\nall the attention it deserves. If I had to condense this movie into a\\nfew words, \"intelligence, justice, friendship, being human, redemption\"\\nwould all sound like understatements. Saying anything more about this\\nmasterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. It\\'s just one you\\'ll\\nhave to watch if you love movies.\\n',\n",

As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from\\ntime to time for somebody Red doesn\\'t find it particularly odd that\\nandy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in 1949.Of course he\\naccepts.The line that defines this great piece of cinema is \"get busy living or\\nget busy dying\".This movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and\\nremember always- FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE!\\n',\n",

Despite not having a great success while\\nit was at the theaters, now with the VHS and the DVD, a lot of people\\nis having a chance to enjoy 142 minutes of greatness and get away from\\ntheir boring lives at least for just a while. I find the twist that the\\nstory makes when Andy escapes from shawshank as simply perfect and\\nunexpected. The only thing i consider that is wrong on the film is that\\nwhen the movie is over you want to see more and you can't see more\\nbecause the movie ended and ended perfectly, but i think that with a\\nmasterpiece like the shawshank redemption not even 10 hours of movie\\nwould be enough. Well i've got a lot more things to say but i don't\\nknow really how to express myself. So if haven't seen it, what are you\\nwaiting for? just put your shoes on a go running to the video and i\\nknow you'll enjoy it. I would like to know who is Allen Greene, i'll\\nget very happy if you e mail me back telling me who he is. Simply the\\nbest movie ever made.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is the only film I have seen more than once. The cast is first\\nrate with everyone giving a great performance. Morgan Freeman takes the\\nfirst place and also Tim Robbins shows a great performance. There are\\nmany memorable scenes in the film. This film can change your point of\\nview for the life, it has that power. It teaches not to give up. Thanks\\nto Stephen King (short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption)\\nand Frank Darabont (screenplay) and all others who made that fantastic\\nfilm. I can not call it just a film.

       " u'\\n\\nThis film is hard, exciting, realistic, beautiful and surprising.

       " u'\\n\\nFrom the outside, the Shawshank State Prison looks like an English country\\nhome, with turreted corners and a wide open surrounding lawn.   It\\'s only\\nwhen you get inside and see the walls and meet the brutal guards that you\\nstart to realize that the state government simply wants you out of sight and\\nout of mind.  And that if you die in Shawshank, the only reason that might\\ninterest the government or the public is that it will save them money.The two main protagonists are Andy Durfresne (played by Tim Robbins) and\\nEllis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman).  Andy is the new\\nprisoner, a banker and investment expert convicted of killing his wife and\\nher lover.  Red is the experienced con, who makes do on the inside by\\nsmuggling cigarettes, whiskey, tooth brushes, movie posters, etc. into the\\nprison, and facilitating a market between the prisoners and between the\\nprisoners and the guards.Two other important characters are prison Warden Norton (played by Bob\\nGunton) and the Captain Hadley (wonderfully played by Clancy Brown). Andy,\\nobviously, isn\\'t your usual prisoner.  For one thing, he doesn\\'t look very\\ntough, certainly not tough enough to have killed anyone. Red bets that Andy\\nwill be the first of the new draft of prisoners to \"break\" during their\\nfirst night locked in cells, by crying.  And \"The Sisters,\" prisoners who\\ndelight in raping other prisoners, target Andy from day one.Well, both Red and \"The Sisters\" are wrong. Andy doesn\\'t say a bad word\\nabout his confinement or his cell.  And \"The Sisters\" have to beat the Hell\\nout of Andy time after time to get any enjoyment out of him.  (Another\\nfeature of prison life which Andy doesn\\'t complain about.)  What Andy does,\\nis try to get on living. He has this hobby of rock carving, for which Red\\ncan supply the necessary tools and rocks.  He is also good at doing things\\nlike filling out tax forms and giving investment advice. This skill comes to\\nthe attention of the Warden and the guards, especially Hadley.  Soon,\\nalthough not soon enough, Andy is given a trivial job in the prison library\\nand protection from The Sisters in turn for providing investment advice to\\nthe guards and, for laundering all the money the Warden is making off the\\nfree labor he controls.Andy does other things to.  Over time he manages to turn the dark,  basement\\nlibrary at the prison into a real library where other convicts can simply\\nread or, with ambition, try for their high school credentials.  In other\\nwords, Andy, although a convicted murder is good for the people around him,\\neven a bunch of convicts doing hard time.Is this the way prisons really operate? Can one person make the difference?\\nWell, probably not. In fact I suspect Shawshank is shown to be a nicer place\\nto live than any real state prison is, but the level of gross brutality\\ndisplayed in the movie by both the guards and by some of the prisoners was\\nall I wanted to see and enough to convince me that I wouldn\\'t want to live\\nthere. Also, this is a movie about redemption, a rare enough event in\\nordinary life to motivate some \"suspension of disbelief.\"There\\'s the other side of redemption too, which is punishment of the truly\\nguilty.  The Shawshank Redemption supplies both. And has fun doing so. In\\nfact, when I saw most of the movie by accident on TV, I - who never watches\\nTV - found myself yelling at the kids to be quite so I could follow\\neverything that went on.  And then I went out the next day and rented the\\nvideo both to enjoy watching it again, and to help answer some left over\\nquestions, like \"who really did get redemption?\"I strongly encourage you to see the movie to find out the answer to that,\\nand several other questions. \\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nWow. I love this movie. To date I have probably watched it nearly 40\\ntimes... I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch\\nit.For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on how\\nthey make me feel. This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies, angry when\\nTommy dies, and happy when Red finds his friend. This movie makes me feel\\ngood. I know that is not very scientific, but it's the truth. Because of the\\nway it plays on me, I can't help but give it a 10. Here's\\nwhy:First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a\\nperson that tries to bury his innocence, because in reality it does not\\nmatter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant, as usual. But here\\nthe supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances.The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie, the\\nrelatively unobstructive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see, the\\nwalls of Shawshank. We feel them, through the music, and break through them\\nas Andy does.And last but not least, My compliments on the cinematography. The site is\\nperfect for the movie, and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us\\ninto the dreary prison world.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nOne interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass.  The\\nmovie could have continued this story for another 2 or 3 hours and I don't\\nthink it would have lost my interest.  I think just because normal people\\nlike this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the 'movie critics'.\\nThe best movie ever???  Definitely.  Everything else pales in\\ncomparison. \\n\",\n",

I\\nconstantly said to myself: Ok, I'll go to the library at the next commercial\\nbreak ... but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the\\nfirst 5 minutes... and by and by I forgot I was watching a film. Finally\\nwhen it was over I was left tearful and speechless. It was that powerful an\\nexperience. I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching\\nthe film. Those 3 hours are worth every second of it, I can tell you that! \\n\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nShawshank describes one of the most honest truths of this world today--hope\\nis the reason we keep on living.  The reason Red was able to overcome his\\ndesire to kill himself or anyone else (to break parole) was the hope of a\\nbetter life helping Andy.  I think that this main theme is best described in\\none of the end sayings---get busy living, or get busy dying.  Great\\nmovie! \\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nRun Tim Robbins's name in the database, and I don't think you'll find that\\nhe's starred in too many movies worth watching.

Carefully written, deliberately paced, lovingly\\nacted, this film brings you in and leads you to the light on the other side.\\nNothing is forced, but not a single plot thread is left dangling.\\nHollywood needs a lot more movies like this one.

It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red\\nhope and to bring good to what was evil within.  This movie has everything a\\nmovie needs.

Andy is sent to prison after murdering his wife and\\nlover. Claiming he is innocent of the crimes, and was the victim of an\\nunfortunate coincidence, the law does not believe him, and sentences him to\\nlife in prison without possibility of parole. Once inside, he immediately\\nbefriends a criminal by the name of Red, played brilliantly by Morgan\\nFreeman. Andy then becomes the victim of fear, despair, and the prison\\nitself, which is inhabited by crooked officials and hardened criminals.\\nAfter a while, Andy finds the hope inside of him to never give up, with the\\nhelp of his friend Red and others. He starts doing tax returns for the\\nprison guards and the warden, and after a while, the warden, played by Bob\\nGunton, who makes the viewer loathe the word warden, has Andy doing his tax\\nfraud for him. It\\'s safe to say that Andy is \"friends\" with the\\nofficials.I don\\'t want to give it away for those of you who haven\\'t seen this picture,\\nbut believe me, you will be breathless. The hope Andy holds inside of him\\ngives all of us a warm feeling inside of us, and tells you to never give up.\\nThe cast is perfect in every way, and the film just carries beautifully. You\\nwill find yourself praying for Andy through the whole film, through bad\\ntimes and even good times. It is wonderfully capped off with a surprise\\ntwist ending that will leave you shocked, stunned and emotionally\\nbreathless.I call this film my all time favorite, because I agreed with the characters,\\nfelt for them, hoped for them and in the case of the corrupt characters,\\nloathed them, due to great acting.

       " u'\\nWhen i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i\\ncan learn a lot of things from it.\\xa1\\xb0The Shawshank Redemption\", which is a movie about time, patience and\\nloyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the\\nsubterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving\\nlife sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off\\ndespair.The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been\\ninside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its\\nleading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\\ncandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\\nday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners\\nunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\\nprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\\nDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy\\nturns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him\\nis such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing\\nseems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he\\'s in for\\nmurder. He\\'s apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details\\ninvolving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality;\\nall that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who\\nis not - and the measured passage of time. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes\\nup in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his\\nterm (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been\\nrehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out\\nof his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that\\nhe has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills\\nhimself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on\\nthe outside. Red\\'s narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the\\nprisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives\\nthe years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is\\nnot violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob\\nGunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about\\nbookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he\\'s been moved out of\\nhis prison job in the library and assigned to the warden\\'s office,\\nwhere he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden\\'s\\nill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he\\'s doing the taxes\\nand pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get\\nsome cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or\\nwhen he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he\\noversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What\\nquietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he\\naccepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than\\nonly he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison\\ndrama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence,\\nriots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason.\\nThe movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\\nRedemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King\\'s work.\\nThe horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that\\nflows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man\\'s life have\\nunreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and\\nshadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of\\ntheir own. Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as\\nFreeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His\\nclose observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way\\nwe monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those\\naround him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden\\nand secret, which is revealed only at the end. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may\\nhave made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it,\\nand warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There\\nis even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But\\nmostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\\nworth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\\nmiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a\\nsense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\\nredemption.All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to\\nwatch, the most important sentences \\xa1\\xb0Hope is a good thing , maybe the\\nbest of things, No good thing ever dies.\\xa1\\xb1 It is really make us\\nthinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that\\nthere has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage,\\nbecause every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of\\nfreedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are\\ncovered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no\\nmatter how difficult it is!

       " u\"\\n\\nI have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of\\nall time.  That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the\\nmovie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical\\nacclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out.  Now that\\nI see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on\\nprobably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am\\neminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best\\npicture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted\\nfilm, but it is nothing compared to this.  Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim\\nRobbins turns in his best performance.  If you haven't seen this\\nmasterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.\\n\",\n",

Although it\\'s my favorite, my choice was based mostly on my\\npersonal reaction toward this movie and I did not expect that there are so\\nmany people that feel the same way I do about it. I love every single\\nthing\\nabout this movie, every single shot. And believe me I know what I\\'m\\ntalking\\nabout because it\\'s the only movie that I\\'ve seen so many times and it\\nnever\\nfailed to amaze me.A great story based on Steven King\\'s novella, great\\ndirection by Frank Darabont, and great acting by Tim Robbin and Morgan\\nFreeman. Not to mention music, and the truly original and always inventive\\ndialogue. Every body who commented here on this movie probably mentioned\\nall\\nthe obvious great things about it. I would like to add one thing that made\\nthis movie even more spectacular to me. The movie contains scenes that\\npresent a complete idea that stand and work on its own. Like the scene\\nwhen\\nAndy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof. Critics might choose others,\\nbut\\nthere\\'s no other movie touched my soul like this one, and I\\'ve seen\\nthousands of them.

       " u\"\\n\\nIn the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday\\nafternoon I knew it was my favorite.  I was captured instantly by how the\\nstory unfolded.  You can't help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain (I don't\\nknow if thats spelled correctly).  The way he speaks with thought and\\nhope,\\nthe way he walks about the jail collecting rocks.  Seemingly oblivious to\\nthe fact that he is imprisoned in a jail.  They couldn't have found a\\nperson\\nthat suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman.  His voice is\\nperfect for the narration of the film.  Every card played by this movie\\nwas\\nan ace.  From the way they filmed the tall, barren walls of the prison to\\nthe brilliant story( thanks to Stephen King for that), and let's not\\nforget\\nthe music.  I am pleased to see that it's in the top spot of this site, I\\nthink it deserves it.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nIn this era of television, and cable television, and satellite television,\\nwe are bombarded with movies, old movies, new movies, PPV movies, made for\\nTV movies.

You may be absentmindedly changing\\nthe channel on a Saturday afternoon, or late on a Friday night when you\\ncome\\nacross one, a scene, any scene, will play. Whether it be from the\\nbeginning,\\nmiddle, or end, it hardly matters-- it is immediately recognizable to you.\\nYour mouth will begin to make the words the actors are to say,\\nunconsciously. A smile may come to your face as does a friendly, warm\\nfeeling inside, you may feel a tear, or fear the tear to\\ncome.You will move aside the bedclothes you were changing in order to find a\\nspot\\nto sit on the end of the bed, you will adjust the volume to your taste.\\nYou\\nwill not go for a drink, or a snack, but remain, transfixed.Such is the magic of movies, and there are many movies for many people,\\nbut\\n\\'The Shawshank Redemption\\' is one for us all. It is the sweetest music,\\nand\\nour conductor, Frank Darabont is indeed a maestro.The wonderful story behind the making of the film starts with  the\\ngenerosity of  Stephen King. King of course gets a premium price any time\\none of his novels is adapted. He has chosen to give young, unproven\\nfilmmakers an opportunity to adapt any of his short stories (as opposed to\\nthe novels) for the bargain basement price of $1. There is only one\\ncaveat,\\nthat they send him a video tape of their finished film. This opportunity,\\nFrank Darabont took to advantage and made a short film, based on a King\\nstory, \"TheWoman in the Room\".  And King was impressed. When years later\\nFrank Darabont came back to King hoping to adapt something called  \\'Rita\\nHayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\', King was only too happy to\\naccede.What came from Mr. Darabont is true cinematic history.

       " u\"\\n\\nOk, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I\\nfeel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn't rate a movie\\na 10.First of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long\\ntime. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into\\n(unexpectedly) a true buddy story.I could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length -\\n2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were\\nextremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I\\nalso have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones -\\nespecially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real\\nlife could leave that out???Also, prison movies in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's are not my favorite\\ngenre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really\\ndon't care very much what period it takes place in. Anyway, that is just\\npersonal preference.All in all, it deserves the praise it gets. I'm very glad I finally took the\\ntime to watch it.  \\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\nThe great Morgan Freeman continues to spin out superlative performances.\\nThis is one of his finest, a difficult and complex portrayal of a veteran\\nconvict, who is so long a part of the numbing prison culture that we\\'re\\nsomewhat surprised by his sympathetic understanding of the unfortunate Andy\\nDuFresne, movingly interpreted by Tim Robbins. People are in prison, for the\\nmost part, because they belong there. Prisoners don\\'t normally exude\\ncompassion for their fellow unfortunates, but Freeman\\'s \"Red\" noticed right\\naway that DuFresne was of different stuff. Their friendship cut across both\\nracial and social lines, and that it was forged in the furnace of a prison\\nconducted by so corrupt a warden as Norton, was a magnificent testimony to\\ntheir bond. Clancy Brown as the warden\\'s personal storm trooper could have\\nbeen reduced to caricature, but he turned this difficult role into a\\nmemorable portrayal of mindless violence. The great revelation in this film\\nwas Bob Gunton as the warden. There has rarely been, if ever in film, a\\nkeener reading of a character given the charge of men who\\'ve been reviled by\\nsociety, and thus forgotten and who are totally dependent upon his good will\\nfor their very survival. Norton was the essential bureaucrat who, given\\nsufficient backing from an indifferent public, can build from the\\nfoundations up, a system which brutalizes and murders men, and which\\nexploits the last vestiges of their self-respect for his personal ends. The\\nnarration by Freeman in his great baritone lent an authentic base line for\\nthe kaleidoscopic unfolding of the film. James Whitmore\\'s poignant turn as a\\nman doomed to death outside of prison is proof of what lengthy incarceration\\nto do to a man, turning him into a slave who is addicted to the very\\nstructure which denies his humanity. That both DuFrense and \"Red\" each\\nmanaged to leap over the abysses which yawned before them, was the great\\ncathartic experience of the film.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe Count of Monte Cristo isn\\'t a very good book, and has spawned a few\\npretty poor films, but it\\'s the ideas which make it an enduring story.\\nNow whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas\\'s\\n(\"Dumass\\'s\") book when writing the original short story I don\\'t know -\\nwhat I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour, typically\\ncoarsely-detailed potboiler and evolved it into something special. The\\nbig step for me, was that having taken an interesting idea and made it\\ngood, Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who\\ncould make it sing. I don\\'t think there\\'s a dull line of dialogue in\\nthe movie, and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted. Why\\nit is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce\\nthe kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars (like\\n\\'Braveheart\\' did in the year \\'Shawshank Redemption\\' was nominated) I\\'ll\\ntruly never fathom.

       " u\"\\n\\nI think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made.\\nThe acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on\\nother occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror\\nstory like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system\\nwith so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump\\n(FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the\\nhope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows\\nthat there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society\\nand aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be\\nmissed or inappropiately criticised.\\nI also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as\\ngood as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points.\\nMay we all hope for more movies like these.PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as\\nwell. \\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nShawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was,\\nand some of them (many of them) said, \"Shawshank Redemption,\" and I\\nsaid, \"I haven\\'t even seen it.\" And they assigned it to me as homework.\\nI started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in\\nfact, seen it before.That\\'s how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on\\nIMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I\\ndon\\'t? I wish I could know, but I can\\'t except by reading their\\ncomments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don\\'t think it\\'s a terrible film, despite all the\\npicking I do. I\\'m trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect\\nand think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I\\nlike, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to\\nknow. Please don\\'t read further if you just want a confirmation of why\\nthis is a great film. In brief, I don\\'t think Shawshank probes,\\ninvents, or seduces aesthetically. It\\'s just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the\\nleast, and a really good \"wordsmith.\" His stories work with simple\\nconflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing\\nhappens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a\\nturn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That\\'s pretty\\nmuch the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the\\ncharacters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but\\nflimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful\\nblack man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates),\\nand the thoughtful white man who doesn\\'t like anyone (at first), played\\nby Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the \"twists\" are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and\\nthat was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really \"realistic\" in\\nany sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there,\\nfrom rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as\\na \"fable\" it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final\\nhappy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it\\nwould naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently\\ninteresting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar\\nclich\\xe9s, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on\\npurpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and\\nenjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and\\nwarm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to\\nfastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second\\ntime seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn\\'t\\nseen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual\\n(those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because\\nit\\'s obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let\\'s tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was\\nleisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it\\'s\\ndrawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, \"movie music\" pure and simple, in its\\nlush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it\\ndirectly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or \"bad\" especially, but\\nthat\\'s hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But\\nreally, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those\\nnow famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of\\nthe movie doesn\\'t crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die\\nHard have more inventiveness. Isn\\'t Shawshank presenting Hallmark\\nsentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No\\nfaulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some\\ngreat filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some\\ngood night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few\\nmoments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the\\nescape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed\\n\"nicely\" so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be\\ncaressed and not assaulted--it\\'s not an action adventure film, so I\\ndon\\'t expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable.\\nOh, I\\'m sure Frank Darabont doesn\\'t mind the cult status of his movie,\\nbut he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of\\na lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all\\nhad to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more\\noriginality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the\\nShawshank we have. It\\'s not a shame, obviously, that we have what we\\nhave, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn\\'t\\ncare for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so\\nagain, it\\'s just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that\\nthere are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn\\'t go\\nthe places I need a great movie to go. It\\'s not a bad movie, not at\\nall. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much\\nmore than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me\\nas flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child\\'s lie. It is content to be\\nsuperficial, and I, personally, am not.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe amazing thing about this film is how many people fail to realise\\nthat the film is about Red, not Andy. It's Reds perspective of Andy. I\\nonly mention it because many people strangely think its told from the\\nperspective of Andy.That common misunderstanding behind, a well made film. The photography\\nis magical, the story is strong, the performances are exceptional and\\nthe depths of despair and humanity of canvassed well without losing\\nmainstream appeal.But that aside, there is a strong willingness to overstate this film.\\nIn the end, it is a slightly overdone and there is a bit too much\\n'triumph of the human spirit' dribble on the side. But I don't let that\\nget in the way of what is otherwise a very good film with\\nre-watch-ability.Hadley's release from prison and letter deserves a spot in cinema\\nhistory.

       " u\"\\nShawshank Redemption, The (1994) **** (out of 4) An innocent man (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison on murder charges and\\nonce there he bonds with another man (Morgan Freeman) serving a life\\nsentence. I remember seeing this when it was first released to theaters\\nand walking out thinking it was a masterpiece but apparently others\\ncouldn't be bothered to see it since the box office results were very\\nlow and it was out of theaters in no time. Over the years the\\nreputation of this film has grown and as I write this it's currently #1\\nat IMDb. I certainly wouldn't call this the greatest film ever made but\\nit's certainly one of them. I think it's an insult to call this a\\nprison movie because it's so much more than that. This is a film about\\nfriendship and hope. Those are two things that have played major parts\\nin many movies but I can't think of too many films where the payoff is\\nas large. What makes the film work so well is that director Durabont\\ntakes his time telling a story that takes place over twenty years.\\nAnother wonderful thing the director does is that he really makes the\\ntwenty years pass on a believable manor. Most films that jump time feel\\ncheap and rushed but that's not the case here because the wonderful\\nscreenplay lets us get to know the two main character but also the\\nsupporting characters are very well written. What really brings this\\nmagic to life are the performances, which are downright brilliant and\\nI'd argue that you can see some of the greatest ensemble acting right\\nin this film. Robbins and Freeman are terrific together and really make\\nfor one of the most memorable friendships in movie history. The way\\nRobbins walks and talks is perfectly done and I just love the way, as\\nFreeman says in his narration, he walks around as if he didn't have a\\ncare in the world. Freeman gives another wonderful performance but\\nwhat's really great about him is the narration he adds as he tells us\\nthe story. James Whitmore is terrific as the elderly convict and Clancy\\nBrown and Bob Gunton make for excellent villains. I won't spoil the\\nending for anyone but the final twenty-minutes are at times\\nbreathtaking in their beauty and it's message of hope rings louder than\\nmost movies.\\n\",\n",

It was the most enjoyable thing\\nI could have watched that night.Every part of the story is engrossing from the very first scene. The\\nfilm has a way about itself that is uniquely its own. From the way it\\nis shot to the musical score (a masterpiece by Thomas Newman).Any film enthusiast, writer, storyteller, actor, or human being must\\nwatch this film. It is masterfully executed from one scene to the next,\\npristinely edited, and in so many words...perfect. I myself am a\\nfilmmaker and have hard time watching even great films without judging\\nwhat I consider mistakes scene-by-scene. Shawshank pulls me out of that\\nawareness and into a wonderful story and I have watched again and\\nagain. It never stops being great. As a writer or storyteller I have the utmost respect for Mr. Daramont\\nas well as Mr. King. The dialog throughout the film is understated and\\nmagnificent. There are more than half a dozen classic, memorable scenes\\nthat I consider iconic from this film. And to top it off, the\\nperformances from all the actors, specifically Mr. Freeman and Mr.\\nRobbins, are timeless.If you have not seen The Shawshank Redemption please make a point to\\nmake sure you do at some point soon. It is one of the best films ever\\nmade.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nShawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made,\\nand definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King,\\nand I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and\\nmoving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw\\nit as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I\\nseriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first\\nreleased now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The\\ndialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in\\nyour mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the\\nprison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the\\nscript, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am\\nnot a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books.\\nBut in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the\\nlanguage represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the\\nfilm with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and\\nthe superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at\\nthe new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was\\nexceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a\\ngreat job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes\\nfrom Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar,\\nthat he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very\\nstrongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean\\nConnery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal\\nrange, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In\\nshort, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The\\nscene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the\\nspeakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in\\nBrook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to\\nscreen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the\\nexception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are\\ngenuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from\\nbeing classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers\\nthat border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant\\nfilm, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long.\\n10/10 of course. Bethany Cox.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nsimply the best movie ever made. this movie embraces the philosophy\\nthat justice will be done, karma is heard and that goodness will rule\\nabove anything in this world. Andy and reds friendship is a strong\\nunique bond, founded under the harshest of circumstances. In prison\\nthey each serve their time for situations they got themselves into, but\\ncertainly didn't form them as men - or messed with their true\\ncharacter. Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate, that he\\nwill be in Shawshank forever - and on the surface he rises to the\\noccasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden, who treats\\nAndy like the lowest of the low. In the meantime Reds parole is\\ncontinuously declined, and they both have to re-adjust, even though\\ntheir life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of\\nfreedom. Will the time really come, and if yes...are they ready for it?\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nAn excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the\\nquestion that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers\\nin the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal.\\nAre the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities\\njustifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the\\nauthorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has\\nto take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and\\nmay bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are\\nfans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix\\netc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by\\nMorgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will\\nleave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather,\\nit is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie\\nrating lists for long. There are a few weak points though. There was\\ninsufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just\\none side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison\\nauthorities.

       " u\"\\n\\nAndy Defresne is a young banker who goes to pieces when he learns his wife\\nis being unfaithful.  He gets drunk and wakes in his car, where he is\\npicked\\nup for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Despite his pleas of\\ninnocence, Andy is sentenced to life in prison where he is immediately\\nintroduced to the horrors of live inside.  Fellow lifer, Red, tells Andy's\\nstory of how he held hope and managed to use his banking skills to improve\\nthe conditions for himself and others.I saw this film in the cinema when it came out and, looking back, it is\\nsurprising how little fuss was made over it at the time - I was one of 15\\nor\\n20 people in the cinema when I saw it (on it's second week out!).  However\\ntime has brought it to the top of many popular lists of films and it is\\nmainly due to a story that is based around friendship and hope that\\nengages\\nand eventually uplifts.If you are going to adapt a Stephen King book, the lesson from this film\\nand\\nothers appears to be to adapt a short one.  Here the story is set up well\\nwith all the usual stuff that we expect from prison dramas, but with the\\nkey\\ndifference that these events are not the film - no the film is about Andy\\nand Red's friendship.  These two men are great characters and I was very\\neasily drawn into their story.  It is witty, dark and yet enjoyable all at\\nthe same time.  It is impossible not to be affected by the ending and this\\nsimple uplifting sentiment is part of the reason it has been taken in by\\nso\\nmany viewers as one of their favourites.Of course it is a little long at times and for my personal tastes it is a\\nlittle too sentimental at times although this is to be expected with any\\nHollywood film.  The slightly sentimental view of the prison also goes so\\nfar to ignore the idea that there would be any homosexual relationship\\nthat\\naren't rape and even ruling out any suggestion of racism - there is no\\ntension or segregation in evidence here.  I won't do spoilers but the\\nending\\nwas too clear for me where leaving us with more questions would have been\\nmore in holding with the idea of hope that the film had traded in prior to\\nthis.  The characters work well due to some great performances.  Robbins\\nis\\ngreat as Andy and he ages and grows well - whether or not he is believable\\nin his calm approach to the punishment he takes is another matter, but I\\nwas\\ncaught up in the film enough to get past that.  Freeman may not be the\\nIrish\\nguy from the book (hence the name Red) but he is excellent as the father\\nfigure - even if he appears to age very slowly in comparison to Andy.  The\\nchemistry between the two is the key and it really works.Of course having a support cast that includes a great number of fine\\nsupport\\nactors probably helped.  People like Gunton, Sadler, Bellows and others\\nmay\\nnot always be great but here they fit the bill. Yes the characters tend to\\nbe very clich\\xe9d (the bird man, the rapists etc) but again that comes with\\nthe genre and I was able to get past these by focusing on the main\\nrelationship.  The surprise performance for me was from Clancy Brown - not\\nthe most subtle of actors (Highlander is his other famous role) but he is\\nvery good here indeed, albeit with little actual character depth.  As\\ndirector Darabont has done very well, framing some great shots (that crane\\nshot as the bus arrives for the first time) as well as a shot that has\\nbecome almost iconic.  He is helped by a score that fits the sweeping\\nsense\\nof hope that the film brings.Overall this is an imperfect film and it is flattered by it regular high\\nappearance on the popular `best film' lists.  However it is also a great\\nlittle story that twists and turns as it is told, it has all the clich\\xe9s\\nof\\nthe genre but at it's heart it is based on friendship and a sense of hope\\nthat it is hard not to find uplifting.  For all it's faults it is a\\npopular\\nand moving story that seems to do the trick for the majority of those that\\nsee it.\\n\",\n",

With a lot of suspense and\\naction it is a movie that everybody should watch. Tim Robbins an actor\\nthat has been in many movies such as Nothing To Lose, Bob Roberts,\\nArlington Road, and many more, plays an important role in the movie\\nShawshank Redemption. Andy Dufresne, who is played by Tim Robbins is a\\nbanker that is convicted of killing his wife and another man that she\\nwas with. While in jail he meets a guy named Red who is played by\\nMorgan Freeman. Red is known as the \\xa8guys who can get things,\\xa8 from\\ncigarettes to rock picks he can get it all. Andy keeps a low profile in\\njail for the first few years. He then becomes friends with a group of\\nguys in the jail that includes Red, but also makes some enemies. With a\\nlot of fighting scenes it helps show the real life events of what jail\\nwould be like. On the other hand, the director does a good job in\\nmaking Andy a very interesting character from his personality and\\nactions. He is very sneaky and persistent, but is also determined and\\nfearless in some situations. The one thing that might turn away a\\nyounger audience is the language. The Director does a fantastic job\\nwith setting the story and letting it play out but also uses a lot of\\nlanguage that would be used in jail. He shows how lonely, how different\\n,how depressing, and how life changing jail can be. Throughout the\\nmovie the audience takes away a lot of lessons that is shown through\\nthe actors lives and stories. One iconic line that I loved was from\\nMorgan Freeman, when he was talking to Andy after he got out if the\\n\\xa8hole,\\xa8 when he said \\xa8Get busy living or get busy dying.\\xa8 Frank, the\\ndirector of this movie directed over 10 movies such as, The Green Mile,\\nand The Majestic. He has been nominated for 3 academy awards and one\\ngolden globe award. He has worked with many famous and well known\\nactors such as Morgan Freeman and Tom Hanks. The movie has won many\\nawards including, best picture, best actor in a leading role, best film\\nediting, and many more. The movie is a well written and well produced\\nmovie that had a lot of twist and turns that grabs the audience\\nattention and keeps them watching and wanting to re watch the movie.\\nThe plot was well put together and flowed throughout the movie which\\nwas shown in many different occasions.

But beyond the cinematic success -\\nperhaps because of it - the film manages to take you to new places.It\\'s a road movie, a 2,000 miles never before attempted sea ice\\ncrossing - but this trek is a fable. Almost an allegory, by its poetry\\nand ethereal landscapes where our own thoughts get unleashed and free\\nto reflect on our own existence and the very meaning of our destiny,\\nhere, in space, or anywhere.By venturing into these unknown territories, the film can barely placed\\nin the documentary genre. Just call it a film, that\\'s what it is. An\\nartistic exploration of actual unknown and of our deepest soul. \"Why do\\nwe Explore\", to quote the film, is all what it is about.

He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\\ncandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\\nday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners\\nunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\\nprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\\nDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy\\nturns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him\\nis such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing\\nseems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he\\'s in for\\nmurder. He\\'s apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details\\ninvolving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality;\\nall that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who\\nis not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes\\nup in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his\\nterm (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been\\nrehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out\\nof his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that\\nhe has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills\\nhimself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on\\nthe outside.Red\\'s narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the\\nprisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives\\nthe years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is\\nnot violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob\\nGunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about\\nbookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he\\'s been moved out of\\nhis prison job in the library and assigned to the warden\\'s office,\\nwhere he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden\\'s\\nill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he\\'s doing the taxes\\nand pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get\\nsome cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or\\nwhen he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he\\noversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What\\nquietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he\\naccepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than\\nonly he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison\\ndrama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence,\\nriots or melodrama.

Red, as\\nFreeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His\\nclose observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way\\nwe monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those\\naround him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden\\nand secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may\\nhave made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it,\\nand warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There\\nis even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But\\nmostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\\nworth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\\nmiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a\\nsense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\\nredemption.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThe Shawshank Redemption: Accepting the bleak and harsh realities that\\npresent themselves in our lives is part of what it means to mature as a\\nperson. No film I have ever seen so deeply encapsulates this sentiment\\nas Frank Darabont's Shawshank Redemption. Two convicted felons live out\\ntheir life sentences in the Shawshank prison, usually by outfoxing\\nguards with red's smuggling network or just rambling with old chums.\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a masterfully crafted film because the\\nexcellent cinematography, engaging plot, and Tim Robbin's acting\\neloquently reflects the frustrations of a wrongly convicted man named\\nAndy Dufresne, and his struggle to maintain one of the most valuable\\naspects of humanity: hope.The outstanding cinematography and drab grey shading help convey a\\nbleak setting at the beginning of the film. Tense moments were\\npunctuated with dark shadows cast over the actor's faces, and\\nintensified further with Morgan Freeman's dulcet narration. The\\nestablishing shots of the prison were dull and grey, akin to the\\nmonotonous lifestyles of the institutionalized convicts that had\\naccepted their lot in life. The somber tone created by dull colors and\\nshading slowly captivated my attention, leaving me with baited breath\\nin anticipation for the events to unfold.The majority of the story was set in Shawshank prison, where our main\\ncharacters, 'Red', and Andy Dufresne stare the reality of a life\\nsentence in the face. Throughout the film, the two main characters\\ncomplement one another with their incongruent views of what being\\nbehind bars truly means. Red believed that they should accept their\\ncurrent situation and make the best of it, whereas Andy tried to busy\\nhimself with his hobbies: keeping his mind focused on things beyond the\\nwalls that caged him. I found this optimistic behavior incredibly\\ninspiring as a viewer. There is truly a positive gem of wisdom to be\\nfound in a person who is thrusted into an impossible situation, and\\nstill finds a perseverance to escape it as Andy Dufresne did.The actors in this film performed extremely well overall, and Morgan\\nFreeman's narration enriched my experience of this film immensely,\\nbecause it complemented Tim Robin's delivery of Andy's character. Tim\\nRobin's acting during Andy Dufresne's first interaction with Red was so\\nwell done, I felt as though Morgan Freedman's narration was manifesting\\non screen rather than being acted out. The entire cast succeeded\\nespecially well in bringing their respective characters to life: not\\nforcefully exuding emotion, but casually, and crisply conveying\\nmemorable character interactions.The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful piece which stands in a class of\\nits own: original, nuanced, and engaging. A great deal of care, time,\\nand consideration was placed into the production of this film. I\\nreflect back on the many other films have emerged in recent decades:\\nfilms that tried to emulate Shawshank Redemption's sleek mature\\nessence, to no avail. Truly this film stands without peer by my metric.\\nI have enjoyed the viewing and critiquing process of this film\\nimmensely, it is truly a treasure which I would recommend anyone watch\\nfor their enjoyment as well.\\n\",\n",

Twenty years organized the escape plan\\nand succeeded thanks to a poster of Rita Hayworth and the Bible. Those\\nwho have seen the movie know that the last exit from prison was Rita.\\n(We do not say details of the film to enjoy it who have not seen) The\\nfilm is based on the novel by Stephen King with the same title, which\\nsold the rights to the book the director and friend, Frank Darabont\\n(Frank Darabont), just one dollar. The Ntarampot changed the title, and\\nconsidered that would mislead the public, in \\xabThe Shawshank\\nRedemption\\xbb. Two months it took to complete the script, which he\\nclaimed was the best he had ever read in his life. Immediately\\npresented to companies and did not take long to start shooting. For the\\nrole of the banker Andy Ntoufrens producers think Tom Hanks and Kevin\\nCostner, but the first two refused and chose Tim Robbins. O Costner few\\nyears later admitted that he regretted that decision. The Robbins spent\\nsome time in isolation to prepare mentally for the role of Andy\\nNtoufrens. For the role of the Red, the retentate coming in close\\ncontact with the Ntoufrens, the director chose Morgan Freeman, because\\nof his voice. Although the description in the book did not fit his\\nappearance Freeman as the Red supposed to be Irish, the director was\\nerect. Indeed, Freeman today sees Red the most important role in his\\ncareer. In September 1994 it came out in theaters. Day projection, the\\ndirector with the producer went into one of the largest movie theaters\\nof America and saw license. The title of the film according to Freeman\\nwas why we failed, but is not fault it. At that time the competition\\nwas tough, as they had been released and the leading Pulp fiction films\\nand Forrest Gump. Although not well went in cinemas caused a sensation\\nin video clubs and is still one of the best films of all time. The\\npublic opinion changed after seven Oscar nominations and after he\\nstarted playing on television. However won no Oscars.

Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack\\nperfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is\\nperfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that\\nmany people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated\\nfor seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere\\nmore people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew.\\nEventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of\\nall time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being\\nwrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to\\nspend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As\\nthe years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic\\ntwist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie\\nhistory.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their\\nperformances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The\\nsoundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this\\nmovie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because\\nof the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman\\nand Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who\\nmade this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate\\nacting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope\\novercomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the\\nhuman spirit.\\n\",\n",

The\\nacting the setting the backdrops and scenes everything is perfect. the\\ndialogue from the prisoners to the guards really leaves you feeling a\\npart of the movie rather than a viewer. Its a movie that leaves you\\nwondering and thinking about the characters and what happens to them,\\nyou actually care about the characters. Shawshank redemeption deserves\\nits place at the top and I don't think there is any movie coming along\\nto beat it any time soon.

       " u\"\\nARE you going to get busy living or get busy dying?Stephen King's powerful message of hope is not lost in the stage\\nversion of his inspiring story, The Shawshank Redemption, at The Lowry\\nin Salford Quays.Adapted by stand-up comedians Owen O'Neill and Dave Johns, the stage\\nwas transformed into 'Shawshank Penitentiary' as part of the play's\\nfirst UK tour.It had a lot to live up to \\x96 Frank Darabont's 1994 movie of King's\\nshort story, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, often tops lists\\nof the best films ever made.But the excellent cast, led by EastEnders' Paul Nicholls, and director\\nDavid Esbjornson brought existence behind the claustrophobic bars of a\\nmaximum security facility to life in front of the audience's eyes.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne\\n(Nicholls) who is serving two consecutive life sentences for the murder\\nof his wife and her lover \\x96 a crime he did not commit.Ellis 'Red' Redding (Ben Onwukwe) becomes his only friend and it is Red\\nwho narrates the story of how Andy changes the lives of all those\\naround him by never giving up.Credit also goes to the stage designers \\x96 the grim prison sets helped\\nput across the life of fear, constriction and routine where the\\ndehumanizing behavior of the guards is often worse than that of the\\ninmates.In this way, the limits of turning Shawshank into a play worked in the\\nproduction's favor.Nicholls and Onwukwe are excellent as Andy and Red and their friendship\\nis the thread that connects the story.Jack Ellis is chilling as the cruel, corrupt Warden Stammas and Andrew\\nBoyer will break your heart as elderly prisoner Brooksie.The only disappointment was the ending which lacked impact. What\\nhappens to Andy at the end of his story is so powerful in the film\\nversion but \\x96 probably due to technical reasons \\x96 it is glossed over\\nhere.The play, set between 1947 and 1966 and peppered with music from the\\nera, will make you ponder on the meaning of rehabilitation, the flaws\\nof the justice system and the nature of power in all its forms.It is a study of human nature and friendship while its message of the\\nimportance of hope over fear is just as relevant now as when the story\\nwas written 34 years ago.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nIt's quite a good movie, but far from the best movie of all time.You won't lose your time watching it, but don't create big expectations\\nabout an revolutionary thing. The movie gets the best part that an\\nAmerican history movie have, with the characteristics that you may\\nexpect from one of this. It's the success, the break through, the plot\\ntwist and the great actors.It's a good way to begin watching the top IMDb, easy to see.Probably it's on the top 1 for natural organic votes through this\\nyears, despite not being all of this.Take your family to watch with you, they will like it. Maybe even you\\nfriends and dates. But don't say to a Cinema lover that it's your top\\none. Maybe a way to discuss about life and society. Even about the\\nculture of American cinematic history and how the blockbusters turned\\nquickly from great plot movies to high amount of explosions and graphic\\neffects, just made for selling tickets, not for art itself.Shawnshaw Redemption gets points by being part of the last farm of\\nAmerican blockbusters with great plots and actors\\n\",\n",

Stephen King is\\nknown for making so many books into movies but after being a fan of his\\nfor over 25 years, only a few of his have really translated to really\\ngreat movies (The Green Mile, etc) like this one has. It is one of\\nthose movies that started out slow but has gained momentum over the\\nyears.

After a quick\\nconviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank\\nprison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in\\nappearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His\\nability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow\\ninmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred\\nto as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the\\ndrab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare\\nto the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope\\ncauses Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.\\nAndy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls\\nof Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\\nscreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\\noutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\\nequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\\nthis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\\nhe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\\nThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\\na focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\\nup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.\\n\",\n",

I do not\\njudge -i kinda really care about that. The walking dead ave the best\\ntechnique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not\\nthe best.

       " u'\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" Movie ReviewA typical prison movie consists of bad food, dirty surroundings, and\\nphysically abusive inmates and guards, while \"The Shawshank Redemption\"\\ntakes this genre to a completely different level. While still including\\nthe filth and violence, emotion plays a bigger role. When directing the\\nmovie, Frank Darabont ought to have wanted to hit the entire spectrum\\nof emotion. During the movie, the audience will feel themselves\\ncheering from the couch, irritated, or holding back a few tears.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of killing his wife and the\\nman she was cheating on him with, and he is sentenced to two\\nconsecutive life sentences. While serving his sentences Andy meets Red\\n(Morgan Freeman), who slowly becomes one of his greatest strengths.\\nAndy uses his previous banking skills to get a job in prison that he\\nenjoys and passes his time with hobbies and devious schemes. The movie,\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is made perfectly using strategic acting and\\nnot to forget about how basic the setting is.Tim Robbins does a fantastic job playing the main character, Andy\\nDufresne. He captivates the audience and keeps them watching his every\\nmove. He creates a walk and a way of speech for his character. I\\nwatched an interview of Tim Robbins shortly after the film was\\nreleased, and I took special notes of the way that he walked into the\\nroom and his tone of voice. He talks softly and walks as if he holds\\nhimself up a little higher than he does anyone else when he is not\\nplaying the part of Andy Dufresne. During the movie, he walks with more\\nof a lost-like stroll and speaks in a deeper, seductive sound. For a movie filled with drama, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has the most\\nbasic special effects. The story took place in The Shawshank Prison for\\nthe majority of the movie, so the only props and backgrounds consisted\\nof brick walls, dirty floors, and rusted metal bars. The simplicity of\\nthe special effects not only contradicted with the action-filled plot,\\nbut it was able to bring the audience into the movie. Everyone can\\nrelate to being in a room with brick walls wanting to break free\\nbecause of how lonely you may feel, which is exactly how the inmates\\nfelt. While the special effects and the props are basic, the plot of \"The\\nShawshank Redemption\" could not have been more exciting. The actors did\\na phenomenal job at pulling the audience into the movie and making them\\nfeel like they are there with the actors. Not only does the movie\\nentertain the audience for a little over two hours, but it also\\neducates the typical movie-goers on some issues in prisons in the past.\\nAt the time the wardens of prisons were finding scandalous ways to make\\nprofits and keep the money for themselves instead of using it for their\\njobs like they should have been doing. The purpose of this movie was to\\npass on the tale of the famous prison escapee and to shame the prison\\nsystems.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nIt is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because\\nit makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious\\nexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and\\nlooks. It uses the narrator\\'s calm, observant voice to include us in\\nthe story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper\\nthan most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship\\nand hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former\\nbanker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his\\npoint of view. The film\\'s opening scene shows him being given two life\\nsentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move,\\npermanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and\\nparticularly the lifer Ellis \\'Red\\' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his\\nvoice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff\\nbreeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn\\'t\\nmake it in prison.From Andy\\'s arrival on the prison bus to the film\\'s end, we see only\\nhow others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old\\nlibrarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our\\nsurrogate. He\\'s the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it\\ncomes, is Red\\'s. We\\'ve been shown by Andy\\'s example that you have to\\nkeep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet\\nexample and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple\\nchoice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy livin\\' or get busy dyin\\'.\"\\n',\n",

In the film the most important for the\\nprisoners is the hope, and is the thing the Andy never forget \\'cause he\\nknows he\\'s innocent and a lot of his Friends believe it.In prison Andy happens a horrible situations but he never lost hope; he\\ndo a good things for the prison and mates, like the library and help\\nwith the finance, but everything is with in other sense; he wants his\\nfreedom. So he do a perfect plan to escapes, but never tells anyone, so\\nhis plan is secret. Before Andy puts his plan in action, his friend\\nBrooks is released, he has a new opportunity but he falls into\\ndepression and commits suicide.After time,Andy manages to escape, he achieve steals the money of his\\nboss, as Andy helps with his finance; He is a smart person if i can\\nsay. After that, one of his best Friends (Red) archive get out to\\nprison, Andy hidden leaves money to Red for go with him to Zihuatanejo.\\nFinally both of them are together and starts a new life. I recommend\\nthat movie, is a good one.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI think that this is a very special movie because it tells us the\\nimportance about having faith in ourselves as humans beings and showing\\nour values.It also tells us that justice, truth and god have a way of finding us\\nthrew out life itself, for example the main actor in the movie Andy got\\nhis way out of jail, not because he was escaping but due to the fact\\nthat he knew he was innocent. One of the things that i like about the film is that its for all\\nviewers because it has no nudity scenes, but the violence and the bad\\nwords are very explicit.With this movie you can realize the importance of freedom and that true\\nfriendships do exist and that every person has someone that cares about\\nhim, it could be a family member or a friend that's always going to be\\nthere by your side, i guess at the end you can say that the movie has a\\nlot a significant moments where you can find many meanings to them. To finish of i can say that i really recommend this movie to all\\nviewers who are looking forward to a different experience and purposes\\nin films. Also a kind of meaning that i personally found about it is\\nthat we as persons have 2 options in life we either dedicate ourselves\\non living and trying to find our own happy ending or throw everything\\nto the side and fail, which is not any kind of goal or fulfillment.\\n\",\n",

The first time I saw this I only saw half of the film\\nand I really wanted to keep watching, the cliffhangers were really\\ngood.The moral of the story is that even though there may be many obstacles,\\nno matter how difficult, you must never abandon friendship. At the same\\ntime teaching about how hope is one of the other things you must never\\nforget no matter where you are. In this case Andy Dufresne and how he\\nreceived a double life sentence and how he never gave up even though\\neverything was against him.Some people think its not a really good film but they need to watch it\\nover and over again so they can have a better understanding of it.

This movie has an ambient that is just rare and hard to find in any\\nother movies nowadays, but as well the excitement of the movie ends\\nwith it. This is not a movie you end up talking about with your friends\\nfor weeks passionately and at least in my opinion I didn\\'t feel like I\\nwas watching the best movie that there is out there. I really don\\'t know how to express myself properly or at least I feel\\nlike it, so this isn\\'t easy to write, I think that the level of\\nexcitement about a movie depends on the personal disaster that there is\\ninside everybody\\'s head and how much a person identifies with a\\ncharacter or a piece of the story-line of a movie and a reason of why\\nthis movie had so much success it\\'s because it accomplished to manage a\\nvery wide range of deep personalities in it\\'s characters so this made\\nplenty of people feel somehow connected with at least one of them.\\n',\n",

Andy helps Tommy\\npass the high school equivalency test. Helping others aids Andy in\\npassing the time. Another example of this can is when Brooks, played by\\nJames Whitmore tries to cope with life outside prison. He does not\\nlearn how to deal outside the jail and commits suicide.

       " u'\\nI believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I\\'m\\nabout to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of\\nmurdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in\\n1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an\\nunlikely friendship with \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how\\nto get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance\\nwith the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to\\nhelp the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story\\nunfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal\\nof respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-\\nclass. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman\\nmaybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film\\nhad a familiar feel, it wasn\\'t even slightly pretentious or clich\\xe9d, it\\nwas original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a\\nreal impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all\\nother films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on\\nthe story and the way in which it unravels. It\\'s a powerful, poignant,\\nthought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to\\ncomment on this film, I think he might say: \"Get busy watching, or get\\nbusy dying.\" Take his advice.i have now started finding movies better through flickstree.com. it not\\nonly suggests great movies but it also helps us to find out where to\\nwatch these great movies. highly recommended.\\n',\n",

There is a lot of life and humor in\\nit, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red.\\nThere is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it.\\nBut mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of\\npersonal worth, despite everything.

The\\nfilm is based on Stephen King's novel: Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank\\nRedemption. It's a story of 2 prisoners : Red and Andy's prison life\\nand how both men lives are bonded for 20 years in the prison. Frank Darabont's outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of\\nStephen King's Novel. His direction and script is one of the best in\\nfilm history. Morgan Freeman perfectly acted out one of the most recognisable\\ncharacter in film history: Red. In the film, his voice matches\\nperfectly the tone and rhythm of the lines he was suppose to say.\\nAlthough, some will say Freeman should have won the academy award in\\n1994 for Shawshank Redemption, I personally still feel Tom Hanks should\\nwin the award (like he already did) because although both actors'\\nnarration was extremely good, Hank's acting was better than Freeman. In conclusion, I feel Shawshank Redemption should remain it's status as\\none of the best drama films ever made and should be remembered forever.\\n10/10\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nThe short novel by Stephen King has been adapted by Owen O'Neill and\\nDave Johns and is likely to prove popular with fans of the film as well\\nas those who are too young to remember the original format. Based on\\nthe 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption, the play\\nexamines desperation, injustice, friendship and hope behind the bars of\\na maximum security facility. The 1994 feature film, regularly voted\\nBritain's favourite ever movie, starred Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman\\nand was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Two of TV's best loved\\nleading men, Ian Kelsey (Doctors, Casualty and Emmerdale) and Patrick\\nRobinson (Casualty, Midsomer Murders), star in this new production of\\nThe Shawshank Redemption, which is running at Milton Keynes Theatre\\nuntil Saturday. Despite protests of his innocence, Andy Dufresne is\\nhanded a double life sentence for the brutal murder of his wife and her\\nlover. Incarcerated at the notorious Shawshank facility, he quickly\\nlearns that no one can survive alone. Andy strikes up an unlikely\\nfriendship with the prison fixer Red, and things take a slight turn for\\nthe better. However, when Warden Stammas decides to bully Andy into\\nsubservience and exploit his talents for accountancy, a desperate plan\\nis quietly hatched. A minimalist set is the perfect backdrop as the\\nstory unfolds in the confines of the prison walls. Dim lighting with\\nthe sound of doors slamming and keys turning makes you feel as though\\nyou were inside the 'Shank' with the inmates. The onstage partnership\\nof Kelsey and Robinson has a genuine warmth to it, and this is\\ncomplimented by their co-stars who bring both light and shade to the\\nperformance. No one can miss the distinctive laugh of Rooster,\\nwonderfully but hauntingly captured by Leigh Jones, and Ian Barritt as\\nBrooksie and George Evans as Tommy Williams shine in their 'darkest'\\nmoments. Owen O'Neill is perfect for the role of Warden Stammas,\\nchillingly bringing a sense of fear to the stage every time he\\nfeatures. With the film's cult status, some die-hard fans may not like\\nthe fast-pace of the stage adaptation, which takes you through the\\nyears inside at a much quicker pace than the original film. But there\\nis no harm in breathing new life into a classic and if you loved the\\nfilm, why not indulge yourself in re-living it in a new format. The\\nshow contains strong language and adult content and is recommended for\\npeople aged 15 and over.\\n\",\n",

There is no doubt that\\nthe Shawshank Redemption is the best in its own era, as a 1994 American\\ndrama film, and it marks the career top of Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman. As it is adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth\\nand Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne,\\nthe banker who was sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary\\nfor the murder of his wife and her lover. It tells the story of who\\nclaims of his innocence works his way out from scratch by a\\nnon-innocent way. During his time at the prison, he made friend with a\\nfellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and got himself protected by\\nthe guards after the warden begins using him in the money-laundering\\noperation. Surprisingly enough, the film was a box office\\ndisappointment, despite the fact that it received multiple award\\nnominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive\\nreviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. There is no\\ndoubt that today it is considered to be one of the greatest films of\\nall time. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the\\nfilm for preservation in the National Film Registry, due to its\\nculturally, historically, or aesthetically significance.\\n',\n",

This 'could' be described as a\\nfilm showing the insanity of the penal system, as an illustration of\\nthe potential for corruption in all institutions, but the overwhelming\\nfeeling generated is the determination to crush the human spirit.

It's a\\nfilm that I can always be in the mood to watch, whether I'm feeling\\nhigh or low due to the unbelievably victorious ending. The entire film\\nis beautifully shot, with no need for any special effects and it does\\nso well based solely on the story itself, the phenomenal acting from\\nTim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red.The basis of the plot, for those who haven't seen it (where have you\\nbeen hiding?!) is Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is accused of\\ndouble homicide of his wife and her lover and sent to Shawshank prison\\nfor two life-sentences in the 1940's. Shawshank prison is full of\\ncorruption and when evidence that can prove Andy's innocence is\\ndiscovered, even this can't help him escape the walls, so he must find\\nan alternative.My personal favourite scene is when Andy finally escapes the prison,\\nafter digging through his cell wall with a rock hammer, crawling\\nthrough 500 feet of sewage pipes and coming out the other end with the\\nwardens forged accounts. Andy stands at the end of the sewage pipe with\\nhis arms raised looking up to the sky, finally feeling free.Andy is also my favourite character in the film, and Tim Robbins earned\\nhis place as one of my favourite actors after this role. Andy is known\\nto be a quiet, calm man - wrongfully accused and locked up, trying to\\nget through day-to-day of his sentence. Tim Robbins never raises his\\nvoice above a whisper, is softly spoken and this lends itself to your\\nfeelings and sympathy for Andy from almost the very start of the film.\\nHis relationship with Red is a thing of beauty, showing two men from\\ndifferent backgrounds - one actually guilty of murder - becoming close\\nfriends with mutual respect for each other.There is no part of this story that isn't incredible, the film doesn't\\ndrag for one moment and you genuinely want more when the credits roll\\nup.The film is based on the novella by Stephen King 'Rita Hayworth and\\nShawshank Redemption'.\\n\",\n",

This\\nmaster class motion picture, equipped with not only some of the finest\\ndirecting (Frank Darabont) and Cinematography (Roger Deakins) we've\\never been treated to as an audience, but one of the greatest film\\nscores (Thomas Newman) ever composed and in my opinion, the most\\nexcellently written and simply beautiful story in a film since the\\ninception of the motion picture written by the one and only Stephen\\nKing.I can not give enough praise to this film, it was every thing I look\\nfor in a film and so much more. The Shawshank Redemption is not just a\\nfilm, it's THE film.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis movie was truly excellent and deserves its place as a masterpiece.\\nThere just is no other movie that compares. The character development\\nin this movie was incredible. I never would have imagined that a movie\\nabout prison could have turned out so interesting. The environment of\\nthe movie displays prison as a dark terrible place which nobody wants\\nto find themselves. It's definitely dated when compared to the modern\\nprison system of today but still shows the brutal and harsh reality of\\nfinding yourself as a inmate during this time. Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman did an incredible job of allowing the viewer to fully connect\\nand to sympathize with their plight. The movie was also very filled out\\nwith many other interesting characters.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nFrank Darabont\\'s \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a good movie. It has a\\nsolid cast, a solid script, and solid cinematography. The film is at\\ntimes engaging, moving and thrilling. You\\'d be hard-pressed to find\\nanything particularly wrong with it.But that doesn\\'t make it a great movie.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a very safe film. Not so much in terms of\\nstory, but in how it\\'s executed. Frank Darabont directs the film\\ncompetently, and seems content to stay at that level the whole time.\\nRoger Deakins, possibly the best cinematographer working today, seems\\nto be phoning it in, and the usually excellent Thomas Newman provides\\nan unmemorable score. Everyone seems to be operating at three- quarters\\ncylinder, enough to be good, but never enough to be amazing.This extends to most of the performances. Tim Robbins as the wrongfully\\nconvicted Andy Dufresne is not a particularly engaging lead. Bob Gunton\\nand Clancy Brown are fun in antagonistic roles, but they\\'ve both given\\nmuch better performances. The ensemble cast of prisoners is game, but\\nvery few of them are given much to do.The standout performance is easily Morgan Freeman\\'s Red, who helps Andy\\nnavigate life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, and that has more to do\\nwith Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman than it does anything to do\\nwith the role.There is little wrong with \"The Shawshank Redemption\". But it takes\\nmore than having nothing wrong to make a great film. A great film\\nrequires risky decisions, new ideas or masters of their craft bringing\\ntheir A-game. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has none of these, and that\\'s\\nnot a bad thing. It\\'s a decent film. Just not a masterpiece.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant\\nmovies I have ever seen.Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in\\nalmost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King\\nis a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul\\nand moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things\\nwith it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and\\nthe acting is so top-rate it\\'s almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the\\nmurder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy\\'s relationship with \"Red\"\\nRedding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to\\nescape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as\\nWarden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around;\\nthe most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal)\\nas Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy\\'s who suffers under the iron will of\\nNorton.If you haven\\'t seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be\\ndisappointed. It is positively the best movie of the \\'90\\'s, and one of\\nmy Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul,\\nand heart. 10/10\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThe movie sets an example of the impact the world of cinemas can induce\\non us. In the current scenario where the movie makers, directors, all\\nlook to lure the general public with science fictions and other high\\nstuffs, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION takes a rest. It creates its story\\naround traditional background of common characteristics like hope,\\nbelief, self-esteem, transformation and most important redemption. The\\nmovie is set on location of prison, that is quite a thinking, say\\ninnovation in this field as well. The best thing about the movie is the\\nfact that unlike many movies which focuses on hero, this movie focuses\\non the surroundings. In that way it binds us to the surrounding and\\nhelps us to live as a part of movie with respect to common persons. We\\nfind ourselves in unison with the feelings of sorrow, hope grief, etc.\\nWhile maintaining the poetic and moving dialogue, Darabont also proves\\nthat a film can generate a great deal of emotional response from its\\naudience with its dialogues only. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few\\nwords, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He does not\\nvolunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings. It is\\noften better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know. Coming to credits away from acting part, Roger Deakens have done a\\nbeautiful work as far as cinematography is concerned. The positions of\\ncamera and the awe struck beauty of prison shown in starting scene is\\njust mind blowing. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs,\\nand there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the\\nearly murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's\\ndescription of the crime. Darabont wrote the film to observe the story,\\nwhile a little focus on punching it up or upstaging it. The actors are\\ncontent to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way,\\nand the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. The movie is really a not one timer. You can taste its flavor again and\\nagain. The movie will tend to bind you in its surrounding many times\\nand in years to come.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThe story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been\\ninside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its\\nleading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes,\\ncandy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One\\nday he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners\\nunload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in\\nprison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy\\nDufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy\\nturns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him\\nis such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing\\nseems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he\\'s in for\\nmurder. He\\'s apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details\\ninvolving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality;\\nall that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who\\nis not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes\\nup in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his\\nterm (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been\\nrehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out\\nof his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that\\nhe has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills\\nhimself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on\\nthe outside.Red\\'s narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the\\nprisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives\\nthe years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is\\nnot violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob\\nGunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about\\nbookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he\\'s been moved out of\\nhis prison job in the library and assigned to the warden\\'s office,\\nwhere he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden\\'s\\nill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he\\'s doing the taxes\\nand pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get\\nsome cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or\\nwhen he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he\\noversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What\\nquietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he\\naccepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than\\nonly he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison\\ndrama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence,\\nriots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason.\\nThe movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank\\nRedemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King\\'s work.\\nThe horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that\\nflows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man\\'s life have\\nunreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and\\nshadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of\\ntheir own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as\\nFreeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His\\nclose observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way\\nwe monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those\\naround him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden\\nand secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may\\nhave made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it,\\nand warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There\\nis even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But\\nmostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal\\nworth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its\\nmiddle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a\\nsense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final\\nredemption.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nCons : This movie is kinda very slow-paced, but it might fit its nature\\nand its plot.However, this should not be the first movie of all time, because it ,\\nas a matter of fact, isn\\'t.

Few more cons would be stated , but I\\'d go with the pros : A\\nmovie that beats all expectations, so is the plot, and so does it,\\nbecause whenever you see a scene , you expect something, but it goes\\notherwise.The ending is really good, few movies manage to strike the bullseye\\nwhen it comes to endings.

       " u'\\nI am not a writer, consequently any review I might make will not\\ncapture the essence of what I wanted to articulate. Therefore instead\\nof a review, I\\'ll give a statement regarding this film: This is one of\\nthe few times where a film\\'s success, it\\'s overall feeling and merits,\\nsurpasses that of the book (or in this case story), and in stating\\nthis, there should be no decrement to what Stephen King wrote. In regards to books being made into films, I feel that each version\\n(film and story) itself enhances the other, and each should not be\\ncompared or critiqued for what is lacking, or plentiful. Instead, they\\nshould each be looked upon as a separate entity, with each \\'form\\'\\nevoking our emotions in their own unique and separate way!In order to make these statements, I have to say that I have read the\\nStephen King short story (or novella), \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank\\nRedemption\". I have also listened to the audio-book, and all three\\ninspire, give hope and yes even define the word \\'Redemption\\', in their\\nown unique ways.One might not be able to fairly compare an apple\\'s flavour, to that of\\nan orange, but you certainly can compare a Granny Smith to a Red\\nDelicious. They are both apples at the core, it\\'s the texture, pulp and\\nflavour that make it different. That core could be a story, and each\\nmedium (written, visual, audio etc) provides a similar, yet unique\\nflavour to be savoured!\\n',\n",

My Conclusion \"CAN\\'T\\nBEAT A CLASSIC\".The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and\\ndirected by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and\\nShawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a\\nbanker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the\\nmurder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence.\\nDuring his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd\\n\"Red\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the\\nwarden begins using him in his money-laundering operation.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nIt is hard to believe the one place to find hope and inspiration comes\\nfrom a prison drama. Yet, regardless of this fact, it is a life\\nchanger; true awe inspired amazing film, it explores the true meaning\\nof being a human and, beyond that the truth behind friendship. This is\\n\"The Shawshank Redemption\". In a nutshell, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is the story of Mr. Andy\\nDufresne and his journey to reach the films title: redemption. A man\\naccused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two\\nconsecutive life sentences. He is shipped to Shawkshank Prison, in\\nMaine, to spend the rest of his life. Over the next 10-20-30 years, he\\nfinds his way to peace, truth and holds onto great hope in the midst of\\nthe terror of the prison system.The performances in the film is top notch. Andy is played perfectly by\\nMr. Tim Robbins. The true hero in this piece is \"Red\" by the one and\\nthe only Morgan Freeman. He narrates the film and shows the development\\nof each character, and above all characters he changes the most.\\nConsidering he is one of the oldest characters, he contradicts the old\\nsaying of \"you cannot teach a old dog new tricks\". Change is always\\npossible, to those that are willing and hold on to hope. Another\\ncharacter that is beautifully painted is that of Brooks, who has been\\nin the prison the longest and has really known nothing else. He has\\nbecome \"institutionalized\", and has intern lost hope for the future and\\nhis life.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one of those films that is a true work of\\nboth art and magic. It is a perfectly painted picture of a man who will\\nnot reliquish the only thing someone cannot directly take away: hope.\\nFrom first shot of Shawshank prison - an utterly Gothic structure that\\npermeates you with a sense of just how frightening the prison will be -\\nyou are enveloped inside of the world of Shawshank. You experience a\\nprison life composed of routine after routine after routine after\\nroutine.The remarkable staying power of this film is visible with every new\\nshot in the film. It is able to sustain itself throughout its duration\\nand to keep you enraptured with its remarkable hopeful story.It seems important to write this review now, in a low point of my life,\\nand watching the movie (quiet a few times) I have realized new and\\nimportant points of the film. It has uplifted me and gave me hope,\\nhowever in different ways then it did when I first saw it in early\\n2000\\'s.In the end, this is one of those movies that need to be seen by all.\"Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no\\ngood thing ever dies.\"\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nStephen King\\'s books have a distinctive voice - warm, sincere, inviting\\n- that probably accounts for the appeal of his fiction just as much as\\nhis macabre imagination.Yet none of the many movies adapted from King\\'s work have managed to\\ncapture his singular, light, immediately recognizable tone.Until now, that is: \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" a first feature written\\nand directed by Frank Darabont, finds the perfect cinematic equivalent\\nto King\\'s style. Based on the nonhorror novella \"Rita Hayworth and the\\nShawshank Redemption,\" this is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film,\\nwith just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief\\nto its glowingly benign view of human nature.Like much of King\\'s work, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is about an\\nexceptional individual at odds with society, picked on or persecuted\\nfor the gifts that set him apart. In this case, the gift isn\\'t\\nsupernatural, like Carrie\\'s telekinetic powers, but moral and\\nspiritual.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a gangly young banker when he enters\\nMaine\\'s fortresslike Shawshank State Prison in 1946, accused of killing\\nhis unfaithful wife and her lover. Though his protestations of\\ninnocence don\\'t carry much weight, his shy manner and decency does.\\nBefriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran con who is the prison\\nfixer, he soon draws a circle of other boyishly likable prisoners\\naround him, including William Sadler as a sweet-tempered thug and James\\nWhitmore as a cuddly old man who is the prison librarian.Like \"Forrest Gump,\" to which \"Shawshank\" bears a coincidental but\\ncommercially convenient resemblance, this is a story of saintly\\nendurance. Though Andy is abused by a prison bully who rapes him, a\\nbrutal guard who beats him and a crafty warden who uses Andy\\'s banking\\nskills to launder the vast amounts of cash he\\'s siphoning off the\\nsystem, Andy\\'s patience, tolerance and selfless concern for his fellow\\nman see him through.The poster girl on his cell wall turns from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn\\nMonroe to Raquel Welch, before providence rewards him with an\\nopportunity to get some of his own back.Those poster girls remain pretty much the only female presence in this\\nsnug, all-male environment, where the warm camaraderie suggests less a\\nprison than a boys\\' club on an epic scale. So sweetly juvenile is the\\nfilm\\'s perspective that it comes as a shock to realize, in the final\\nact, that King\\'s story is at heart an elaborate revenge fantasy.In a film that stands or falls on the central character\\'s amiability,\\nTim Robbins is loose and effective, though the real performance here is\\nfrom Morgan Freeman, whose projected affection for his friend really\\ndetermines how we feel about him. Darabont\\'s direction is precise and\\nassured, without being terribly imaginative.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nOne can\\'t be involved with IMDb without hearing, seeing, reading such a\\nlot about this \"epic\". It has been top of the ratings since forever,\\nand the user-reviews are superlatives-on-steroids! But can I really\\nhave rated 40 or 50 or more that are 8, 9 or 10? Yep!I saw the trailers, and wasn\\'t really impressed - just another US jail\\npic? So I read some reviews, and saw other clips. Eventually, the local\\nDVD shop had it on a super special, 3 disc set AND the complete script\\nin a book, all for just $5! gosh, the book would have cost that much\\nfor the paper? So I doubt if Castle Rock, or Columbia or anyone\\ninvolved in making it, got a single cent?So I started with disc 3, boring pseudo-interviews with the main\\nactors. Didn\\'t learn much there, and the \"behind the scenes\" clip was\\nonly 9 minutes and not very informative, so, to disc 2 and eventually\\nwatched the actual film. By now I\\'m a bit overloaded with superlatives.\\nBut then thought about the tiny flaws, ie, Robbins as the main\\ncharacter Andy. Insipid, unconvincing? maybe, doesn\\'t come across as\\neither an innocent inmate, nor as a super clever. Norton the warden\\nlooks and sounds more like a small-town bank manager and acts like a\\nmodern big city corrupt banker? Hadley, the awful captain of the guard\\nlooks more like a \"upwardly mobile professional\"?The other inmates are\\nforgettable (except Brooks, the OLD guy). The \"get busy living or get\\nbusy dying\" scene confuses me, that is what I call a \"sillyism\". It\\nmeans whatever you want it to mean.I note that there is almost zero female participation? Well, it\\'s a\\njail story of course, not much room for skirts. On my rating system, I\\ngave it a 1 out 2 for the story, 1.5 out of 2 for the character\\ndefinitions, 1.5 out 2 for the acting (Freeman is great of course), 2\\nfor the filming, I kept noticing the colours and contrasts even in the\\ndull setting, and only 1 more for the directing and production. 0 for\\nspecial scenes! then 1 more for the dvds!disc 1 also has a commentary by Frank Darabont, which didn\\'t really add\\nmuch. But he does comment on the question of how the poster got put\\nback up after the escape! \"Get over it, it\\'s movie\" True.

       " u'\\nThere are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to\\ntell a story by Stephen King. But \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" based on\\na King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title,\\nsucceeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle\\nstory of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds\\npoetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank\\nDarabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes dangerously close\\nto sounding one of those \"triumph of the human spirit\" notes. But most\\nof it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over\\nnarration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont\\'s film has a genuine\\ndignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine,\\ncircumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named\\nRed and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell block. The film\\nspans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife\\'s murder, the judge pronounces him\\n\"a particularly remorseless and icy man.\" He sustains that chill when\\nhe first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even\\nwhen those inmates threaten him with physical harm. \"I wish I could\\ntell you that Andy fought the good fight,\" says Red, who knows Andy has\\nbeen gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film\\'s only\\nhalfway-brutal episodes. \"I wish I could tell you that, but prison is\\nno fairy-tale world.\"By : JANET MASLIN The New York Times Published: September 23, 1994\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nIt is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but\\n\"The Shaw shank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because\\nit makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious\\nexperiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shaw shank\" slows down\\nand looks. It uses the narrator\\'s calm, observant voice to include us\\nin the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is\\ndeeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on\\nfriendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is\\nthe convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is\\nnever seen from his point of view. The film\\'s opening scene shows him\\nbeing given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her\\nlover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing\\nthe prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis \\'Red\\' Redding\\n(Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw\\nAndy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and\\npredicting, wrongly, that he wouldn\\'t make it in prison.\\n',\n",

I might already some time watching this movie, however\\nthe sensation I get always vary when watching this movie. And do not\\nforget how this film inspires us, that never loses sedetikpun\\nexpectations. Because of the hope it will make us survive, however\\nDespite suffering we alami.dengan storytelling is not too fast this\\nfilm is very nice to enjoy, like listening to a song that we like and\\nwill never be bored for us to listen to. I think it would be difficult\\nto find a film like this again in a few years.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that the majority of\\npeople will love, and yet, it can be hard to pinpoint one particular\\nreason why. The performances are stellar, in fact it's hard to think of\\nany particular cast member who lets the team down, but that's not it.\\nThe set design is suitably bleak, the dialogue is just the right\\nbalance of realism and poetry, and we once again get to hear the dulcet\\ntones of Morgan Freeman's narration, but again, these are not what make\\nthe film great. Everything comes together with Shawshank, creating an instant and\\nintense atmosphere that can be gritty, distressing, and at the same\\ntime, hopeful, humorous and beautiful. This film portrays the\\ncharacter's life and experience with frank honesty, with the undeniable\\nquality of the production only serving to support this incredible\\nstory. Even the score is impressive, adding tension even when you don't\\neven notice it's there. The only reason I don't give this film a ten is because it is not\\nusually a genre that I love, and although this film is definitely an\\nexception, I cannot say it is outright perfect. But it's damn near\\nclose!\\n\",\n",

If you probe too deeply into the\\npremise you're not going to have any fun, but fun is what this movie\\noffers, glorious mindless fun and, above all, fabulous apocalyptic\\nvisuals of twisted metal, crepuscular landscapes, dark hulking ruins,\\nand men crawling through them to fire off weapons at the evil birds,\\nwhich look very graceful as they sweep through the skies and spurt out\\nlong expanding streams of fire The other large positive factor is the\\nvery solid, mostly English cast including a number of appealing\\nyoungsters\\n\",\n",

Yep, it also has that. An unforgettable quirky narrative? You\\nbetcha. Now, given my rating of a 9, I obviously did not find this movie to be\\na somewhat modern masterpiece.

       " u\"\\n//////SPOILERS INCLUDED////////// Before I begin this review I would\\nlike to state my age and the date. I am 16 years old and today's date\\nis July 16th 2016. I know thousands of reviews have been written\\nregarding this movie but I doubt many have been wrote through the eyes\\nand mind of a teenager. This film was originally recommended to me by\\nmy uncle when I was the age of 14, at the time I shunned the offer. 2\\nyears later I have sat down to watch this film and I can comfortably\\nsay it was one of the best decisions I've made. The movie begins with\\nan innocent banker Andy Dufrene (Tom Robbins) being sentenced to\\nShawshank prison for the murder of his wife. He soon is introduced to\\nthe trusty Red (Morgan Freeman), their friendship blossoms and this\\nadds to the raw cinematography. I can honestly say from the eyes of\\nnaive teenager this is one of, if not the best films I have seen. It\\nstems along side another Stephen King classic, Stand by me. The\\nShawshank Redemption is often critiqued along side The Godfarther to\\ndetermine which is the greatest. But personally I believe The\\nGodfarther should put it's success down to the director Francis Coppola\\nand main actor Marlon Brando, without them the movie would not be the\\nsame. Shawshank is genuine and delivers morals with a great perspective\\non life, that being friendship and loyalty is more important than greed\\nand success. It's very rare to find a film that really hits you and\\nmakes you actually contemplate what should be a priority and that is\\nwhy I believe The Shawshank Redemtion is greatest film ever made. Frank\\nDarabont - job well done!\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nOne you could watch over and over and over and ...... This film\\nliterally takes you on a ride where you experience just about every\\nhuman emotion possible. I love the way this movie speaks to you in\\nregards to struggle and perseverance; to never give up. The acting is\\noverall excellent in my opinion with an array of characters and\\npersonalities, some you adore, some you despise. This film kind of\\nreminds me of \"The Fugitive\" theme, but with the main character\\nrestricted by prison walls, guards and other prisoners in his search\\nfor the truth, which he stumbles onto by accident. The climactic ending\\nleaves you feeling \"free\" and will have you ready to watch this\\ncaptivating film again! I would highly recommend this movie!\\n',\n",

The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more\\naimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their\\ncompeting studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a\\npretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I\\nfelt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character\\ndevelopment was very robust for the amount of characters featured in\\nthe film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the\\nmain characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very\\nwell lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely\\ndetailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch.

       " u\"\\nTwo imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and\\neventual redemption through acts of common decency. This is the highest\\nfilm based upon movie reviews here on IMDb with a 9.3 out of 10 beating\\nThe Dark Knight, Terminator 2 and Aliens. The reason why i loved this\\nmovie is the elements it's trying to reach for example friendship\\nbetween all the inmates, corruption of the warden who i enjoyed\\nwatching him die and of course redemption for Tim Robbins and Morgan\\nFreeman. The acting is excellent, the direction is pretty great and the\\nstory is also great a movie that never looses hope made by a very\\ntalented director Frank Darabont. Although the 9.3 rating is a bit way\\ntoo much i mean i enjoyed all the movies i listed on this review a bit\\nmore including Godfather. This movie definitely belongs on the Top 250\\nmovies of all time just not number 1 maybe in place number 10 or 15\\nmaybe? Anyways this movie is great if you haven't seen it check it out\\ni give it a A- and a 8.5/10\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nI really loved the whole movie, the performances of Freeman and Robbins\\nthe enjoy every moment, you hooked from the beginning and then not the\\nwant to let it go, This couple is magic, their connection in the scream\\nis simply art. A film full of injustice, hope, struggle, perseverance\\nand friendship. The courage of our protagonist is suffering every\\nminute. With a shocking and awesome finale. The atmosphere of the film\\nalso helps dialogues to build amazing critic about topics like freedom\\nor the perception of justice. I mean, you don't have to be an expert in\\nfilms to watch this amazing movie, enjoy the beautiful moments in the\\nfilms. Just sit down, enjoys and suffers with this film.\\n\",\n",

It's\\nmawkish, fantastical, sappy and manipulative.

       " u'\\nThe best way to spend a lazy night. it\\'s deeply satisfying prison drama\\nwith sensitive direction and fine performances. This is an engagingly\\nsimple, good-hearted film. Top-notch performances, exceptional\\ncinematography, and masterful direction. \"The Shawshank Redemption\"\\ncomes out of nowhere in the sense that it is a first feature film by\\nFrank Darabont, who, with this one work, declares himself a special\\ntalent. He adapted King\\'s story for the screen and insisted on\\ndirecting the story too, much in the same way that Sylvester Stallone\\ncould not be pried loose from \"Rocky.\" Guts equals glory. Freeman, who\\nis simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his\\ncareer, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative\\nplaying. A 21-year friendship between a lifer (Morgan Freeman) and a\\nNew England banker convicted of murder (Tim Robbins) is the focus of\\nthis gripping 1994 prison drama, capably directed and adapted by Frank\\nDarabont from Stephen King\\'s short novel Rita Hayworth and the\\nShawshank Redemption. A passing reference to The Count of Monte Cristo\\noffers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThe story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\\nvictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\\nthe murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy\\nfinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\\nof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\\nmind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\\nresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\\nall from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds\\ngainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of\\nShawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines\\nof prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to\\ntake a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to\\nRed and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\\nprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\\nscreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\\noutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\\nequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\\nthis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\\nhe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\\nThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\\na focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\\nup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the\\nnovella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great\\ndeal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He\\nemploys the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood\\ncomposer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's\\nneeds by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper\\nsoftly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman\\nlends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the\\nunique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did\\nnot go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.\\nWhile unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on\\nyour concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume\\ndesigners, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood\\nartists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation\\nto work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some\\nof the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While\\nboth Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red,\\nrespectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of\\namazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most\\nnoticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays\\nthe elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an\\nunmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the\\nShawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a\\ntrue dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\\nmotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\\nanything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail,\\nthe most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material,\\nsuch as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts,\\nlike hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human\\nspirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot\\nthat it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of\\nhardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display\\nthe most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable\\nlines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to\\nsucceed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.\\nDarabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and\\ninspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a\\npowerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared\\nit long lost in a dark sea of clich's and predictability. Darabont\\nshows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and\\nproduction facilities. These artists show their capability to produce\\nart; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life\\nand the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed\\nbreath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It\\nproves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still\\nbless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is one of the greatest movies ever. Magnificent performances from the whole entire cast. Morgan Freeman should have won his Oscar nomination for his role.

This movie was released just less than two months before my third\\nbirthday. I did not get the chance to see this movie until I was about eight\\nyears old. Still to this day, it's one of my top five favorite movies of all time\\n(along with Pulp Fiction, The Last Samurai, The Departed & The\\nSandlot). I do not think that there is going to be a movie that is going to\\noutrank this masterpiece classic. If it happens, well... anything is possible.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nI think this was a decent prison drama. And as far as prison dramas go,\\nit's one of the best I remember. But from that to being one of the best\\nmovies of all time, it's quite a stretch. That place is taken forever\\nby movies like Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, Empire Strikes Back, The\\nGood, the Bad and the Ugly, or The Godfather. Still, it has a lot going\\nfor it. The leads are very good, the story is almost believable, and\\nyou actually root for the heroes.I think the reason it got such a good reputation and unlimited reruns\\non TV is that it has a positive message. There is a guy who goes to\\njail for life and he still finds the energy to search for ways to\\nimprove his situation. The crawling through the sewage pipe at the end\\nof the movie is the metaphor for living life with the right mindset, in\\nother words doing all you have to do to regain freedom and dignity. I\\noften compare this movie to Cool Hand Luke, which is very similar, and\\nbetter in many ways. The message is the same, only there is no happy\\nending, so Cool Hand Luke gets a lot less screening.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThis movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and\\ndeep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built\\non from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal.\\nTim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was\\ninspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just\\nmade me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted\\nof murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but\\nyet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\"\\nRedding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest\\nperformance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep\\nregret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain\\naway is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with\\nAndy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy\\nalso becomes friends with the rest of Red\\'s group. James Whitmore also\\ngave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole\\nbut in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this\\nmovie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great\\ncinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but\\nnot in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares\\nmentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don\\'t listen to the people who say this movie is\\noverrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies\\never. It has everything you could possibly want.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nCan Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only,\\ncreate art? To create something of this nature, a director must\\napproach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the\\nprocess. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with\\nan undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of\\neach element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals,\\nscript, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must\\nsucceed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this\\nmixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well\\nknown amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and\\ndirecting, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial\\ndebut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of\\nthe craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable\\nindependent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank\\nRedemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and\\nbrings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense,\\nvictimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for\\nthe murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy\\nfinds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope\\nof parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his\\nmind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this\\nresults in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of\\nall from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds\\ngainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of\\nShawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines\\nof prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to\\ntake a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to\\nRed and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank\\nprison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled\\nscreenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont\\noutdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's\\nequally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In\\nthis novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre\\nhe dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.\\nThough the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates\\na focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came\\nup short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the\\nnovella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great\\ndeal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He\\nemploys the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood\\ncomposer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's\\nneeds by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper\\nsoftly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman\\nlends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the\\nunique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did\\nnot go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.\\nWhile unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on\\nyour concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume\\ndesigners, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood\\nartists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation\\nto work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some\\nof the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While\\nboth Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red,\\nrespectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of\\namazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most\\nnoticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays\\nthe elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an\\nunmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the\\nShawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a\\ntrue dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their\\nmotivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to\\nanything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail,\\nthe most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material,\\nsuch as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts,\\nlike hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human\\nspirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot\\nthat it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of\\nhardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display\\nthe most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable\\nlines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to\\nsucceed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.\\nDarabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and\\ninspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a\\npowerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared\\nit long lost in a dark sea of clich\\xe9s and predictability. Darabont\\nshows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and\\nproduction facilities. These artists show their capability to produce\\nart; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life\\nand the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-\\nneeded breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of\\nfilm. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and\\nstill bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will >never forget\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nMovie starts with the main character falsely accused and sent to a high\\nsecurity prison to carry out the life sentence. Directed gracefully\\ndrives his plot through Andy and it is well supported by Red\\'s\\ncharacter as well. Oh my god, who doesn\\'t love Morgan Freeman\\'s voice.\\nIt\\'s magical and one of the many reasons that keeps us aligned with the\\nstory-line.Not the kind of a movie that would make you laugh and clap while you\\'re\\nat the theaters or when you\\'re watching on Netflix but it definitely is\\none of a kind which comes back to your memory at times and fixes your\\nthinking pattern. Kind of a movie that proves, story- line is always\\nthe VIP of the movie. Each and every conversation between Andy and Red\\nare splendid. Especially the last conversation between these two goes\\nto another level. The words still do a dance in the memory.Prison doesn\\'t scare a man to death but it does steal the whole life\\nfrom him and make him wish that he shouldn\\'t have done what he had\\ndone. The experience of a person who spends more time in prison than\\nthe outside world has been very well used to create the idea of how a\\nprison treats the man and how it changes or rather cultivates him\\nbetter. Let it be Red or let it be Brooks, the portrayal through those\\ncharacters on the mentioned subject is extra ordinary.Determination and perseverance shown through Andy is flawless. He is a\\nman of hope, a hope that lights its own flames to guide us through the\\nscary dark places of life.To conclude, it is a kind of movie that everyone should watch at least\\nonce in their life time.In one word: \"Sublime\"\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is just an epic masterpiece. It's a movie\\neverybody should watch once in their life. Frank Darabont put together\\na legendary film, which at the time he probably did not think it would\\never get this big. Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Gill Bellows, Tim\\nRobbins, and the rest of the amazing cast gave their performances of\\ntheir life's to make this movie such an exceptional one. Looking back\\nat the 1994 Oscars, in my opinion i think it should have won Best\\nPicture over Forest Gump. Honestly, i don't think there is a single\\nflaw in this movie. Its one of the most iconic films ever made. Thomas\\nNewman as well, did great in composing the score for the movie.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is an expose of the mind and what positive thinking can do to lift\\none from the chains of life we endure. Freedom of mind is at the core\\nof the characters. Some savor it and others don't ever use it to its\\nfullest extent.Our thoughts are our wings and even though our lives might be strapped\\nin ways we hate to face such as prison bars, abusive partners or poor\\nliving conditions, we have a way to fly to freedom if we use our minds\\nand thoughts that can yield amazing actions.As you watch the film you will feel as if you are right there with Andy\\nand Ellis. Your mind will dive into the characters without warning and\\nyou will become totally focused because of the intensity of their\\nacting, oops, should have said, emotional commitment to the truth of\\ntheir characters!

       " u\"\\nStephen King is of course, a gifted storyteller. Maybe this might not\\nbe his most personal writing, if you want to read a very insightful\\nbook on prison detention and the atrocities and misconducts that exist,\\nread the Star Rover, it is fantastic.To me, this is filled with far too many shortcuts, basically everything\\nis in hand for Dusfrene to escape. The perfect location, the cell on\\nthe extremity of the facility floor, yet we can't really see where the\\nfoundation leads to, apparently it leads into the pipelines. Also the\\ngreat timing, the fact that he manages to work out taxes, bills,\\nfinances for a 100 person, and in charge of the library, and with a\\nrock hammer that he trades from Red, he breaches a cement wall. I don't\\nget how any of this is realistic - since it's a King's series, might as\\nwell turn into a fantasy. But it's incoherent, lacks coherent flow, it\\nintends to empathy with cons who really seem to be very friendly people\\n(sort of), and might be innocent. I'm not sure these people are all\\nquite recommendable and the camaraderie between detainees necessary -\\nit is certainly the same nature between workers that are part of a\\nunion. I fail to understand how a movie can go two hours and then in a\\nspan of ten minutes, retrace ten years of escape planning without\\ngiving us any hints on where Dusfrene will strike. The scenes where he is revealed that a mobster murdered his wife and\\nher lover makes no sense, it doesn't work, I don't understand it - the\\nscene when he plays opera is tacky - again, this movie reaches. And\\nthen of course, a post-modern ending to a movie that is set in the 60s,\\nwhere two guys meet on the beach, Dusfrene treating a beat up boat.\\nAgain, the development reaches, it is just a series of shortcuts that\\narrange the directors in order to get through it by just being lazy. The performances are dull, there is hardly any real focus, any real\\nacting, it doesn't focus enough on the characters, it moves too fast.This movie just doesn't work.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nBrilliant story and brilliant performance by whole cast and crew. This\\nis simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first\\nto say that and I certainly won\\'t be the last.One of my all time\\nfavorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and\\nthe power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a\\ngreat performance.One of the most touching moments in \"The Shawshank\\nRedemption\" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the\\nbetter part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled\\ninto a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and\\nboyhood memories.The acting is just so passionate and their\\nperformances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The\\nsoundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this\\nmovie. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect\\nmovie\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThe Shawshank Redemption is a classically quiet film about the\\ninjustice served to one man and his consequent adaptive actions. Frank\\nDarabont has shown true talent in the creation of this near-perfect\\nmodest film with most scenes showing deliberate quaint beauty.\\nEmphasizing the beauty of life through many mediums, some ethical, some\\nnot, this film really helps the viewer appreciate life and the little\\nthings. With a cast performing their roles perfectly, this uplifting\\nand high-spirited film is a stand alone about every simple aspect of\\nlife and how we approach it. The Shawshank Redemption is a deserved\\nclassic.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nAll I can say is that some people have to do their research. This film\\nis absolutely backwards and does not reflect reality. It was clearly\\nwritten by someone who has no idea how the prison system works.The protagonist of this film, played drearily by the effortlessly\\ndumb-founded Tim Robbins, is a white man. Not only this, many of his\\nstrangely old convict buddies are white. He is even raped by a white\\nman who he attempts to deter with a mop; he's not a puddle Robbins, you\\nbloody idiot!What the filmmakers clearly don't understand is that in reality, all\\nprisoners are black and I'm NOT being racist, these are just facts.\\nIt's not because they commit more crimes, it is purely white privilege\\ngone mad as no-one will accept them into their prisons and it is truly\\nsaddening to see so much money spunked out on another film attempting\\nto hide this institutionalised love of these creamy coloured pussies.This is just another film in a long line of prison propaganda trying to\\nbrainwash us into thinking that white people commit crimes. Take Cool\\nHand Luke for example: as if anyone would convict Paul Newman. No!\\nThey'd be too busy trying to dive head first into his slacks to get a\\nsuckle of his lean member.At least Morgan Freeman is in the film, an allusion to the reality that\\nFrank Darabont will not recognise for fear of being ostracised by the\\nWhite High Council.Unfortunately, this is not enough to salvage this film and so I can\\nonly give it 2 stars out of 10. One for each true fact portrayed in the\\nfilm. One, that there are black people in prisons and, two, that Tim\\nRobbins would totally get raped in prison.THIS IS ALL A JOKE. THANK YOU FOR READING.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nExcellent movie, hands down a classic. This is one movie that doesn't\\never need to be remade, because its pretty much flawless.

This film changed everything and now i have a deep love to films\\nthanks to Frank Darabont and his masterful directing. Andy Dufresne is\\na symbol of hope, that even though he gets gang raped he manages to\\nfend them off and disable one of them for life. Even though he nearly\\ngets thrown off a building for trying to help a guard, he still manages\\nto get all their protection and basically lives like a free man inside\\nthose walls. he teaches everyone close to him inside that prison a\\nlesson, That when you hope good things happen, Read learns this after\\nAndy escapes, and he clings to hope in his parole hearing and he gets\\nreleased too.I think it is a perfect film and moved me greatly.\\n\",\n",

The dialog, Freeman's narration, the complexity on so many\\nlevels and the layers of the plot, the theme of good vs evil, of never\\ngiving up, the thirst for justice, the intelligence manifested through\\nthe main character...

       " u'\\nThe great sleep gamble People who do not get enough sleep run the risk\\nof developing serious health problems including cancer, diabetes and\\nheart disease, experts have today warned. The British public has been\\naccused of becoming \\'arrogant\\' in ignoring the vital importance of\\ngetting enough shut-eye each night. Smartphones, social media, tablet\\ncomputers and watching television in bed, have all been blamed for\\ninterrupting the body\\'s production of the sleep inducing hormone\\nmelanin.\\'Metabolic health, in addition to genetic predisposition, is largely\\ndependent on behavioral factors such as dietary habits and physical\\nactivity,\\' experts wrote in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology\\njournal. The study said that addressing some types of sleep disturbance\\n\\x96 such as sleep appeal \\x96 may have a directly beneficial effect on\\npatients\\' metabolic health. But a far more common problem is people\\nsimply not getting enough sleep, particularly due to the increased use\\nof devices such as tablets and portable gaming devices. The disruption\\nof the body\\'s natural sleeping and waking cycle, often experienced by\\nshift workers and those working at night, has also been found to have a\\nclear effect on metabolic health, as well as an increase in rates of\\nchronic illness and early death.The prevalence of life-threatening health problems, including cancer,\\ntype 2 diabetes and heart disease is increased in those who compromise\\non their sleep, studies claim. Professor Russell Foster, at the\\nUniversity of Oxford, accused people of being \\'arrogant\\' in turning\\ntheir back on years of evolution that has seen the human species rely\\non the sleep cycle. He said: \"We are the supremely arrogant species; we\\nfeel we can abandon four billion years of evolution and ignore the fact\\nthat we have evolved under a light-dark cycle. What we do as a species,\\nperhaps uniquely, is override the clock. And long-term acting against\\nthe clock can lead to serious health problems.\" A person\\'s body clock\\nis, in part, driven by exposure to light and a need to sleep and rest\\nis the product of a time when people were active during the day,\\nresting at night. But modern life has interrupted sleep patterns. A\\n24-hour society coupled with technology disturbs the natural order,\\nleading people to sleep at irregular times. Experts said smartphones,\\ntablet computers and social media keep people more alert later into the\\nevening. The blue light emitted by the devices has a shorter wavelength\\nthan whiter light, acting to inhibit the body\\'s production of melanin -\\nthe hormone which induces a need to sleep.Havard University\\'s Professor Charles Czeisler said: \"Light exposure,\\nespecially short wavelength bluish light in the evening, will reset our\\ncircadian rhythms to a later hour, postponing the release of the\\nsleep-promoting hormone melanin and making it more difficult for us to\\nget up in the morning. It\\'s a big concern that we\\'re being exposed to\\nmuch more light, sleeping less and, as a consequence, may suffer from\\nmany chronic diseases.\" source: Daily Mail Neh\\xe9zs\\xe9gi saint: k\\xf6z\\xe9pfok\\n',\n",

The implausible plot and an apparent\\nsentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two\\nchief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But\\nwhen characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it\\nstrikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope,\\nfriendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that\\nacts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of\\nthe soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No\\nchance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during\\nincarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of\\nRobbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the\\neasiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\\n\",\n",

Not realistic for me, but it does shows me the prisons we\\ncreate for ourselves that may take years or even a life time to get out\\nof. I think this is the message I get from this film. I liked the film\\nand have watched it several times. I always felt connected in some way\\nto the message it created for me. The message of being a prisoner of\\nour own problems and world's we've created for ourselves from our human\\nnature environments to fashion such prisons. We try as much as possible\\nto get ahead in life and there is always something standing in our way\\nfrom achieving our full potential. This film represents our own prisons\\nwe create for ourselves or the prisons we let others create in our\\nlives as we allow them to control us.

This movie\\nmotivates me to go through the stages that you will get\\nunprecedentedly, unexpectedly in life. Every scene is a realizing part\\nof life that most of the people would not dare to do it in fear. But\\nthis movie shows what exactly you can earn, when you overcome that\\nfear.

       "[u\"\\n\\nIts hard to know where to start with such a breathtaking film. Oliver\\nStone's Platoon is quite simply the best Vietnam war film ever made in my\\nopinion. Everything about it is as close to perfection as we are likely to\\nsee. Charlie Sheen plays the lead, and Willem Defoe and Tom Berenger play\\nthe two sergeants that form a key part of the plot.Chris Taylor (Sheen) is torn between the sergeants. Barnes (Berenger) is the\\nbattle hardened, brutal murderer, who uses the war as an excuse to tender to\\nhis sadistic pleasures. Elias (Defoe) is the other side of the spectrum. We\\nget the sense that he has wrestled with his inner demons, but he has\\nsuccessfully come through to the other side. He has compassion for his\\nfellow man, and he uses drugs as a form of escapism from this brutal war.\\nThe two symbolise the struggle that Taylor must face if he is to survive out\\nin Vietnam.Oliver Stone perfectly captures war. The shooting is frantic and impossible\\nto follow. It perfectly disorientates us, just as the soldiers were. We have\\nno idea who is being shot at, and neither do they. We follow the war at\\nground level, and see the brutalities first hand. Having served in Vietnam,\\nthe film is loosely based on Stone's time out there, and Taylor loosely\\nbased on himself.Full Metal Jacket showcases how inhumane the war was, Apocalypse Now turns\\nit into a story about life in general, and hopelessness, but Platoon has\\neverything. Trying hard to avoid the old clich\\xe9, but if you only watch one\\nwar film, make sure it is this one. Nothing else can come close.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nPlatoon is generally regarded as one of the strongest anti-war films of all\\ntime. While this is certainly true, what\\'s often overlooked -- at least\\nafter only one run through the film -- is that it\\'s chiefly a tale of God\\nvs. Satan, and the war is there to set a perilous backdrop. No doubt,\\nPlatoon shows the Vietnam War was a big mistake, but being a fictional\\ndocumentary on Vietnam is far from its purpose.The story is told from the point of view of Chris Taylor (solidly played by\\nCharlie Sheen), a middle class kid who goes to Vietnam to do what he thinks\\nis his patriotic duty. In the first ten minutes, Chris is shown in the\\nuncomfortable jungle, struggling just to survive in the natural environment,\\nlet alone do any actual damage to the enemy. Quickly we\\'re introduced to the\\nwell-known facets of the Vietnam War: The lack of sense of purpose, the\\nwraith-like enemies, the obvious prevalence of the uneducated and poor among\\nthe fighting grunts -- and, soon, we see how these factors combine to cause\\nwidespread low morale and some actions of more than questionable ethical\\nvalue.Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with one of\\ntwo men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). These\\ntwo really are the driving force behind the film. They both have nominally\\nthe same enemy (the Viet Cong), but, really, it doesn\\'t take long to realize\\nthat Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil (the \"enemy\" does not enter into the\\nmoral equation of this film, at all -- it\\'s an outside threat, same as\\nmalaria-carrying mosquitoes or even friendly fire). I won\\'t deny it is a\\nvery black-vesus-white relationship, but this polarity does not feel\\ncontrived. Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for life;\\nBarnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period. Both are\\nefficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really -- as is at one point\\naptly put by Chris Taylor himself -- they are fighting for the souls of the\\nplatoon members, as the outcome of the war is never really in\\ndoubt.Elias/Barnes\\' hold on the platoon, and the viewer, is developed through\\nseveral war sequences. A chilling scene takes place in a village, where our\\nsoldiers find no VC, but they do find a cache of VC weapons. The inhumanity\\nof certain soldiers, including of Sgt. Barnes, is unflinchingly shown here.\\nIt leaves the viewer with an empty feeling that is hard to shake, reminding\\nof the similarly empty look on a woman\\'s face after she sees her son killed\\nin front her.Elias doesn\\'t take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes come\\ncloser and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran, obviously\\nsiding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes closer and\\ncloser to them, culminating in an explosively shot action conclusion. The\\nend is dark, but morally satisfying.Don\\'t watch this movie for the action. That\\'s not to say it\\'s not well shot,\\nor unrealistic. On the contrary. It\\'s quite convincing. But it doesn\\'t show\\nwar as a fun sport, and it\\'s never a question of good guys versus bad guys.\\nThere will be no cheering for the \"good guys\" or anyone else in this one.\\nStone succeeds brilliantly at putting the viewer into the middle of it all,\\nand it\\'s not a pretty sigh (and definitely not for the squeamish,\\neither).On the other hand, if you want great acting, it\\'s here. Dafoe and Berenger\\ndo incredibly well, with the incredibly good (and seemingly authentically\\nsounding) script. Barnes is horrific as he challenges three men to kill him,\\ndrinking hard liquor out of the bottle. They don\\'t make a move, and neither\\nwill you, though you\\'ll hate him just as much as them. Dafoe is a ray of\\nlight in the dark as Elias. The cast is rounded out with many characters,\\nall well played, and adding another dimension to the film.The technical aspects of the film are superb, though one never thinks about\\nthem much, as the movie is completely engrossing. The production values seem\\nquite good, as well. The most stunning peripheral aspect of this film,\\nhowever, is the music. It\\'s emotional and draining, and used to great effect\\n-- listen for the main theme as you watch the village burn.Watch this one a few times, and you\\'ll likely be quite moved each time. I\\'ll\\nbe surprised if you give it less than what I gave it: 9/10\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThe 1980s in general and the mid 1980s in particular aren\\'t highly\\nregarded where pop culture is concerned , this is most especially true\\nin cinema where films seemed to be written around their soundtrack in\\nmuch the same way as Hollywood movies nowadays seem to be written\\naround their special effects . PLATOON is one of the very few films\\nfrom that period that has an emotional impact , an impact that it still\\nretains while watching it in 2003. Everyone else seems to have mentioned what makes PLATOON a classic\\nanti-war ( Note it\\'s anti-war , not anti American or anti soldier )\\nmovie along with being a classic movie , so I won\\'t go over old ground\\nexcept to say THAT death scene is up there with all the other tear\\njerking scenes from 20th century cinema , don\\'t be ashamed to say you\\ncried If PLATOON has a flaw it\\'s in its duality , there\\'s the good Sarge/bad\\nSarge , good officer/bad officer , good white guy/bad white guy , good\\nblack guy/bad black boy etc which is maybe a bit clich\\xe9d and possibly\\nleads me to believe Stone is making an excuse/reason that the Americans\\nlost in Vietnam because that spent so much fighting each other rather\\nthan the VC ( Though I do concede I\\'m possibly misinterpreting that as\\nan excuse or even a reason since no one will confuse the politics of\\nStone with the politics of John Wayne ) while Taylor\\'s character comes\\nacross as being more of a literary device rather than a real human\\nbeing , but these are minor flawsIt\\'s a shame to see war films from the last few years devoid of\\nscathing anti-war sentiments like the ones seen here .

       " u\"\\nAt the height of the Vietnam War, America's teens are drafted into the war\\neffort to find themselves in the middle of hell.  One such young man is\\nChris Taylor.  He is placed in a squadron where two sergeants have different\\napproaches to the war \\x96 Elias is more about surviving without being brutal\\nor cruel, whereas Barnes is crueller, more ruthless and more violent. \\nDuring the course of his term, Taylor's very soul is torn between the two\\nmen as he deals with what he must do.The first film in Oliver Stone's unofficial trilogy is arguably the best of\\nthe three.  The basic story not only shows us what the war was like for\\nthose serving but also how the different personalities come out of those\\ninvolved in it.  As we follow Taylor we see him change as he is influenced\\nby those around him and by his situation.  It makes for an uncomfortable\\nfilm but one that's worth watching.  It's certainly a better war movie than\\nthings like Wild Geese or The Dirty Dozen, simply because it's a little more\\nreal to what happens than those ones.Charlie Sheen has never been better than when he's acting for Stone.  Here\\nhe gives one of his best ever performances as the innocent who is changed. \\nWillem Dafoe is a great actor and here is no different \\x96 he also gives us\\none of the film's most enduring images so I'm a little biased.  Berenger is\\nanother one for whom it's hard to think of a higher point reached than when\\nhe did this film.  He is brutal and ruthless but he makes us support him in\\na strange way.  The support cast are all good and contains a few famous\\nfaces (John C McGinley, Whitaker, Depp) however this is really a three man\\nshow.Overall this is brutal and violent with no happy ending.  At the end of the\\nday isn't that what a war film should be?\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nPlatoon is a must see for any fan of war movies. The film that put\\nStone on the map, Platoon is considered by Vietnam Vets as the most\\nrealistic (my father having been one of them). But in keeping the maxim\\nof giving credit where credit is due, much of the success of Platoon\\nbelongs to military adviser Captain Dale Dye, who has been linked to\\npretty much every great war movie in the last twenty years. Much\\naccolades to Tom Berenger as well, whose performance as Sgt. Barnes is\\nthe tour de force of his career (the scene in the village towards the\\nend of the movie is brutal, befitting the character). With a great\\nscript, great performances, and awesome cinematography, Platoon is a\\nsurefire classic.\\n',\n",

Well,\\nafter every viewing there is something about Oliver Stone\\'s masterpiece\\nthat\\nkeeps me saying that I have never seen anything better.I am a sucker for Vietnam pictures.  \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"The Deer\\nHunter\"\\nalso rank in my top ten of all time.  Stories about Vietnam can run the\\nentire gambit of human emotions.  \"Platoon\" is not only a documentation of\\nAmerica\\'s sordid involvement in a foreign civil war, it is also a dramatic\\nstory of human response.  A life developing in the most horrible of\\nplaces.There have been films put together better.  There have been films with\\nmore\\ndetailed and interesting plots.  But none have ever told a more touching\\nstory of human development set in the backdrop of bloody violence and\\ninhuman suffering.Rating: 10 out of 10.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nWhy I think Platoon is probably the best war movie Hollywood ever made?\\nBecause it\\'s very humane. I mean it. The director sees all his\\ncharacters as victims of war rather than heroes or villains. Have a\\ncloser look at \\'em.Taylor has no power inside himself and is torn between the two fathers;\\nhe ends up with a physical act of revenge. This is not what one father\\ntaught him - and the other father is actually murdered by him. Sgt. Barnes would never fit the postwar life and knew it damn too well\\nhimself; after all, he is not a fool although might seem a senseless\\nkilling machine at first sight. Vietnamese bullets could not kill him,\\nhis talent for survival being his enemy. So, he attempts kinda suicide\\ntwice (at least) begging others to kill him and thus end the pain\\ntearing him from inside: first, in the potheads\\' bunker scene after\\nTaylor\\'s accusations; then, when Taylor finds him in the final scene.Sgt. Elias was far too good to survive the Nam and maybe even\\nchallenged and annoyed lifers on purpose, waiting for some bob barnes\\nto hit back :) It\\'s a pity Stone excluded the stars\\' scene monologue\\nwhich explains pretty much about Elias\\' ways and view of the future. In\\nfact, for himself he sees no future. Not in this world that is all\\nabout betrayal and killing.Bunny and Junior, one the embodiment of somewhat sadistic bravery and\\nthe other of cowardice. Their deaths are partly a morality, partly to\\nshow that it does not matter if you\\'re black or white, brave or\\ncowardly, war makes no difference wiping off everyone it can. King, Big Harold, Francis are survivors yet victims, too. What is\\nawaiting them in the \"real\" world where nobody understands and nobody\\nrespects anything? They are dreaming of a comeback to music,\\ngirlfriends, fun time - but reality bites, and who knows, will they\\nfind their spot under the sun or will be forced to use the skills\\nobtained in the Nam and get engaged in crime and drug abuse?Red O\\'Neill talking about his ability to predict if a guy is gonna make\\nit or not. A reflection of his own fears: shall I stay alive and get\\nout of here or not. The odds are that he is not, and Stone nails him to\\nthe place with Captain\\'s order to take over what was once the\\nPlatoon... Bye Patsy.The idea that Stone has been trying to bring forward to us is NOT (to\\nmy mind) a story of struggle between the good and the bad for the\\npossession of Taylor\\'s soul (remember, the boy became a murderer in the\\nend), but: where is war there can be no escape. Leave hope everyone who\\nenters.Highest rate ever for that.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI watched Platoon when I was 17 at 1987. I was on the edge of\\nquestioning everything and ready to uprise with a small move. Of course\\nI was fascinated after watching the movie and I remember I was that\\nclose to cry. I can definitely say Platoon is one of the best war\\nmovies of the history. It has many incredible scenes and it reserves a\\ngreat story of brotherhood inside also vandalism and senseless of war.\\nCharlie Sheen , William Dafoe and the great Tom Berenger can easily be\\nconsidered as one the best combination of actors to tell a story of\\nfaith and betrayal in a movie. Oliver Stone did a great job as writer\\nand director. I remember that I was really touched with the letters\\nthat Taylor ( Charlie Sheen ) writes to his grandma. Also with the\\namazing music of the film you feel many different things. I believe\\nthat on the last scene the picture of William Dafoe with his hands open\\non his knees with hundreds Viet Congs coming after him is a masterpiece\\nwork and unforgettable.I watched this movie at Osmanbey Gazi movie\\ntheater at Osmanbey-Istanbul and \\u0131 believe 70's and 80's are the best\\ntime in Istanbul for watching a movie with big saloons and with great\\natmosphere. With 90's big movie theaters started to turn to couple of\\nsmall saloons and with shopping malls movie theaters started to locate\\nat malls. I really miss a lot of 80's and the taste I get from the\\nlegend movie theaters like Osmanbey Site-Sisli Kent-Osmanbey Gazi-\\nPangalt\\u0131 Inci-Harbiye Konak and Harbiye As.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis certainly rates as one of \\nthe best Vietnam films of all time. \\nWhat I especially enjoyed was the \\nrealistic atmosphere of the film, \\nentrenching the viewer into a world \\nwhich seems surreal yet believable. \\nOliver Stone's real-life experience \\nin Vietnam brought a gifted outlook \\nto this film, one drawn by experience, \\nnot common Hollywood conventions. \\nWhile this proved be a lesser film \\nto the equally amazing Full Metal \\nJacket, it was not by much. The \\nperformances by Tom Berenger, \\nWillem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen and \\nJohn C. McGinley were exceptional, \\ncapturing the plight of the tortured soldiers.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nPlatoon left me absolutely numb after watching it. Oliver Stone,(Who in\\nfact\\ndid serve in Vietnam) did a fantastic job telling this story of the horrors\\nand the insanity of the Vietnam war. What's to be admired about this film,\\nis that Stone doesn't sweet-talk the story, with the good old American boys\\nfighting for their country and facing brutality, instead he brings up a\\nstrong morality and humanity issue. It's wasn't all black and white, it\\nwasn't one person was wrong, one was right, there was all shades of gray in\\nbetween. He uses the characters of Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias (both\\nplayed brilliantly) as symbols of good and evil clashing into one another.\\nCharlie Sheen (Chris, the narrator of the story) is in a sense torn between\\nboth, they are both a part of him as he tries to deal with things falling\\napart all around him. Vietnam was a senseless war, and Platoon tries to\\nunderstand why we went through it and how we ever got through it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nA+ Undoubtedly one of the best war films ever made, if not one of the\\nTHE best films of all time. Where to begin with such a film? A lot of\\nthis goes to Oliver Stone, who actually served in the God-forsaken\\njungles of Vietnam. The film really brings to light the atrocities and\\npointlessness of the Vietnam War full force, all cleverly represented\\nby the soldiers who fought these not so courageous and valor-filled\\nbattles.The conflict is simple at a glance; Chris Taylor, played superbly by\\nCharlie Sheen, is a young recruit who in a similar trait to the Civil\\nWar novel \"The Red Bade of Courage\" is naively eager to be a proud and\\nloyal soldier fighting against Communism, as he believes, nobly.\\nHowever, he soon finds that \"the \\'Nam\" is nothing like he thought it\\nwould be. The Vietnam is portrayed as realistically as it will ever be\\nhere: as a chaotic, dark, and all to real nightmare. It is within this\\nhell he realizes that there are only two ways to truly endure the war:\\nGive into near animal instincts, discarding all morals and perspectives\\nof decency or find ways to escape the war at least for short bursts.\\nTaylor decides to choose the latter, but regardless the platoon is\\ndivided by these two choices, on one side being Barnes, who will let\\nthe war consume them completely. The other is Elias, who represents\\nTaylor\\'s last grasp to his humanity. Many choose one path and never\\nturn away from it, despite the fact that many of these men will die\\nregardless. The underlying conflict is how you spend those last\\nremaining days, minutes, instances of life. And all along the Vietcong\\nare just an outside force who the soldiers have no real chance of\\nunderstanding or negotiating with , just one of the many hazards they\\nwill have to survive.Tom Berenger is endlessly great as Barnes, and Willem Dafoe is no less\\nstunning. Every performance is stunning and captures the very real fear\\nof war. Among the many other stand out performances in this picture are\\nKevin Dillon as the sadistic Bunny, John C. McGinley as Sgt. O\\'Neill,\\nFrancesco Quinn as Rhah, Johnny Depp as Lerner, Forest Whitaker as Big\\nHarold and Keith David as the unforgettable King. And the coup de\\ngrace, an unforgettable and heartbreaking score by the late Georges\\nDelerue and Samuel Barber, such beautiful and yet clearly pained music.\\n\"Platoon\" will never cease to be my favorite war flick ever.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThe Vietnam War has been one of the controversial wars in history and\\nwas an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. Oliver Stone\\nharnessed these experiences to make Platoon; a film where he could\\nillustrate to everyone what Vietnam was like from his perspective.In my opinion, this is the best war movie ever made. The sheer horror\\nof war is captured so well in everyway. The fear of death, compatriots\\ndying, divisions in the platoon, guilt of killing; it's all there and\\nStone doesn't try to disguise it. Platoon is very honestly written and\\nit is this honesty that makes the film so great. Platoon isn't an anti\\nwar movie and it certainly does not glorify war in anyway, it is simply\\nhow war is in its entirety. There are some shocking scenes such as the\\none in the Vietnamese village but there are also more light hearted\\nmoments such as where the troops on Dafoe's side are partying and\\nhaving a good time. On base camp, there is great contrast with the mood\\nbut on the forest, it is just fear, aggression and blood, nothing else.Taylor's (Charlie Sheen) story is very good as he experiencing war at\\nthe same time of the audience. Before the war, he was a rich kid who\\nloved his grandma and it is how war changes him that is truly\\nfascinating. The character story that always receives most praise\\nhowever is that between Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe)\\nis very compelling and leads to some great scenes with them and carves\\nan interesting divide within the camp. This film is big on character\\nand explores many relationships but (take note Jarhead) doesn't\\nsacrifice any action time for these scenes. Stone struck a perfect\\nbalance between action and story.Acting from everyone involved is very good. Sheen as the na\\xefve newcomer\\nis very good and after this, should have done much better for himself\\nthan he did. Dafoe and Berenger, once again steal the attention off the\\nlead. Their extreme contrasting personalities is brilliantly done and\\nraises the standard of the film. Berenger is truly terrifying, he\\ndidn't hold back in this one. Dafoe is much more sympathetic and will\\nspeak his mind to anyone. Johnny Depp makes one of his early film\\nappearances with a small, yet memorable role. The way Sheen is wearing\\nDepp's bandana after Lerner (Depp) gets taken by the chopper is\\ndiscretely done but touching.Platoon is the best war movie there's ever been. Stone wrote and\\ndirected this film with such passion that it couldn't be anything but\\ngood. A great mix of characters, a great cast and such well crafted\\naction scenes are all what you need for an exceptional war movie and\\nthey're all here. The film ends perfectly as we are given a chance to\\nreflect and take it in before the credits start rolling. Stone, who\\noften misses the point with his films, hit the nail on the head with\\nthis one.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\"Platoon\" was my first introduction to wartime reality.I was just a kid\\nwhen first viewing it and the film left a powerful impression in\\nme.Before that,I had only seen a couple of Rambo films and thats what I\\nexpected to get here,pretty much.It turned out to be something quite\\ndifferent from that,although it would take me a few years to realize\\njust how different.\"Platoon\" is Oliver Stone\\'s breakthrough picture and a landmark in\\nHollywood history of the 80\\'s.It features almost every well known actor\\non the rise from that era,most notable ones being Forest\\nWhitaker,Johnny Depp,Willem Dafoe,Francesco Quinn and Charlie Sheen.Why is it a landmark film?It helped to bring more understanding into\\nthe hot issue of Vietnam war,although \"Apocalypse Now!\" had already\\nworked out that subject in the most stunning way.Yet there was still\\nsomething left to say for Stone.It was pretty much the same as Coppola\\nsaid,but in another,more harrowing and less complex way.We got a closer\\nglimpse of how it is to die,for one.Dafoe\\'s heroic end is one of the\\nmost dramatic scenes in history of war films.A strong issue here is the abuse of military codes and discipline.Tom\\nBerenger\\'s sadistic,disturbed sgt. Barnes is the perfect example of a\\nwarrior playing god,or angel of death, and fighting a war by his own\\nrules.Berenger plays Barnes so well that it really gives you the chills\\nwatching him and you want him dead.Sgt. Elias is his counterpart in\\nevery way,as he really cares for his men and is in touch with the human\\nin him always.He is not popular among the lowlifes like the redneck psychopath Bunny\\n(great early role by Kevin Dillon) and the spineless racist O\\'Neill in\\nJohn McGinley\\'s incarnation.Another spineless character is the young lieutenant,who on one hand is\\na greater sinner than Barnes.He has no control over the men under his\\ncommand whatsoever and refuses to take responsibility or even feel the\\nguilt for not doing anything to prevent the massacre of the village\\ncommitted by Barnes and his butchers.Here we see the effect that the\\nhorrors are having on private Chris,as he in a fit of frustration and\\nanger over the situation he is in tortures a sick and frail creature of\\na man and ends up in tears.Its a powerful and riveting scene which\\nhighlights the film\\'s message against war,showing its inhumanity and\\nabsurdity in the most shocking way.The final battle is very brutal and well shot.It sums up the whole\\nVietnam war and the strategy of the American army.The napalm kills not\\njust the Vietcongs but also Americans.Ironically,it saves Chris\\' life\\nas he is about to be killed by Barnes during their confrontation.Bunny\\ngets what he deserves and Junior,who is the most despicable of the\\nblack characters here,also dies.This may be seen as director\\'s own\\njudgment.The only other sympathetic character still alive by this\\ntime,the underground lord Rah, is left alive.Francesco Quinn shows here\\nthat he is capable of taking over his father\\'s legacy.In the end,this film is not flawless,but it is a perfect document of\\nthe madness that occurred in Vietnam 1964-73.And its consistent to its\\nvery end,which by the way is very touching and almost made me cry the\\nsecond time I watched it.It is funny how one can feel both happy and\\nsad about leaving a war torn place.Such are the feelings that a war\\nconjures up in a man.It is almost like Chris was sad he was leaving,or\\nmaybe the emotions that were bubbling under surface just came out for\\nreal.Any which way,this film will always be remembered as the one that gave\\na true and unpolished picture of mankind at war at a time when\\nHollywood producers made an attempt to glorify the US army and cast an\\neclipse on its disgraceful stain,transforming the killing into\\nculture.Ironically they succeeded.8/10\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nI may be over analyzing the film.  It certainly appears at first glance\\nthat\\nother than the deer appearing after the battle, and the talk of soul in\\nChris's/Charlie Sheen's final narration there is very little symbolism in\\nthe film\\x85 basically every thing is what it is.However, I believe that even if Mr. Stone didn't intend it, the fact that\\nChris picks up an AK-47 to kill SSGT Barnes is important.  There are\\nweapons\\n(and bodies) all over the battlefield but he picks up the AK-47.  It must\\nbe\\nnoted that the Armalite Rifle or M-16 as it became known had become the\\nweapon of the ARVN forces and the US troops (and is still the primary issue\\nfor US forces today.)  This weapon then, represents the `establishment' or\\nthe status quo power.  The silhouette of an AK-47 on the other hand, had\\ncome to represent revolution the whole world over.  Chris's use of the\\nAK-47\\nwas not to hide the fact that Barnes was killed by an M-16, as Bergerud's\\nbook points out, \\x91friendly fire' casualties were a fact of life in Vietnam.When I combine the integrated `potheads' dancing to \\x91tracks of my tears,' I\\nwonder if the tears are related to the civil rights struggle back home.\\nTaylor's `I volunteered' speech when he gives his reasons that it shouldn't\\njust be black kids and poor kids doing the \\x91s**t jobs' also add to my\\nbelief\\nthat the AK-47 is relevant as a taking up the opposition to fight the\\nestablishment.  Barnes also represented the `lifer' or career military and\\nfrom there one can extrapolate that to include the Pentagon establishment\\nwho tenaciously clung to the belief in some kind of victory in spite of\\nevidence that the population rejected the Saigon government could be had.\\nBy killing Barnes, it seems Oliver Stone might shed a different light on\\nthe\\ncomments Chris Taylor/Charlie Sheen makes at after the rampage at the\\nvillage and the divisiveness it brought the platoon: `\\x85I can't believe\\nwe're\\nfighting each other when we should be fighting them!'  In this view the\\n\\x91Them' could be the establishment that created a world in which a Vietnam\\ncould take place.    His platitudes at the end don't dissuade me from\\nseeing\\nChris Taylor (as Oliver Stone) having undergone a personal sea change. `We\\ndidn't fight the enemy we fought ourselves\\x85'Stone could very well express these sentiments, `The war is over for me\\nnow\\x85\\nbut it will always be there the rest of my days\\x85 as I am sure Elias will be\\nfighting with Barnes for what Rhah called the possession of my soul...\\nThose of us who did make it have an obligation to build again and try with\\nwhat's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life.'\\n`\\x85To\\nteach others what we know\\x85'This obligation statement is almost a verbatim reprise of the defeated\\nJapanese soldiers in the movie `The Burmese Harp' (1956.)  They say the\\nsame\\nthing about a duty to go home and rebuild after the war, though there isn't\\na statement accepting or even acknowledging any wrongdoing. Thirty years\\nseparate these films.  I would not exactly say they claim \\x91war is\\nsenseless,' though they both overwhelm the viewer with the senseless waste\\nof lives caused by war.Other points of note: when we see the APC (armored personnel carrier) roll\\nup behind the patrol looking for survivors after the battle, there is a\\nNazi\\nflag on the top of it (it is very close to the top of the screen and hard\\nto\\nmake out, and is not the typical hakenkruz on the white circle in a red\\nfield, but the one that was meant to express a \\x91pan-Aryanism' with the\\nScandinavian people by having a red field with a black cross outlined by a\\nwhite cross and the swastika in the crux.)  Is Stone implying a fascist\\nnature to this war?Secondly, we briefly see the men who are the despicable `ear collectors' I\\nhad read about in a 1981 book called `Nam.'  They would string the ears on\\ntheir dog-tag necklace as a show of bravado of how many \\x91confirmed kills'\\nthey had.  (Though there are some interesting perspectives brought out by\\n\\x91Nam' much of that book reads like war crimes\\x85)The shot of the lynched soldier was a strange inclusion, considering the\\nBlacks marching against the war at home carrying a banner that stated, `The\\nVC never called me a nigger'.  I wondered why Stone did that.  Furthermore,\\nexcept for a glimpse at a suspected VC in the tunnel shot by Elias, we\\nnever\\nactually see a VC in the film.  The person shot by Elias is not attacking.\\nWe see their tunnels, the arms caches, their posts, campsites and bunkers.\\nIt's always only hints of them.  The only Vietnamese we see attacking are\\nNVA regulars.  Is this saying Stone does not blame the popular Front forces\\nfor attacks on US troops?`Gook' is also used through out the film, as it was in Vietnam.  This word\\nentered the GI lexicon through the Korean War.  \\x91Han Gook' is Korean for\\nKorea/Korean.  The Korean's would see the American's and say `Mi Gook'\\nwhich\\nis Korean for America/American.  The GI's thought the Koreans were saying\\nthey were \\x91gooks' Me Gook.  The carrying of the word from Korea to Vietnam\\nshows the tendency of latent dehumanizing racism \\x91they all look alike'\\x85Speaking of Human, David Lynch, the director of The Elephant Man (1980) was\\nfurious that Stone used Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings since he had\\nused\\nit in his film and hoped when people heard it they would reflect on it.  He\\nmust have sensed that people are now more likely to associate Adagio with\\nthe \\x91Elias crucified' scene.  However, there is another connection to the\\nElephant Man.  Think of Taylor stopping the gang rape.  The GI's respond,\\n`she's an animal!' to which Chris shouts back, `She's a HUMAN BEING, man\\x85 a\\nhuman being!  This is an echo of John Hurt's line in Elephant Man, `I am\\nnot\\nan animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!'There are a few more interesting points worth comment, but I will close by\\nmentioning the suicide attack.  Stone himself was the actor playing the\\nBattalion Commander in the bunker that suffered the suicide attack.  It is\\ninteresting that In response to the suicide attack, Captain Harris, the\\nCompany Commander calls in an air strike right on his own position.  In\\nother words it is as though he answered the suicide attack with a suicide\\nattack.  This seems analogous to the continuing inflow of US troops to\\nVietnam as a suicide.  I will leave it off here in hope that someone else\\ndiscusses the intentional inflicting of wounds on oneself as a means to be\\nsent home.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon has the honor of being the first Vietnam War film made by an\\nactual Vietnam War veteran. Director Oliver Stone based the film on his\\nown experiences in the jungle and the end result was one of the most\\nbleak, violent, unforgiving and brutal war movies made by then.The film might also contain the best performance from Charlie Sheen\\nwe've ever seen. Chris Taylor is an innocent American youngster freshly\\nrecruited into the war effort, forced to grow up quickly within the\\nterror of the battlefield. He's also torn between two man, the\\nsergeants of the company, played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe.\\nTheirs is a private war of ideals and ways of surviving. Both are\\namazing soldiers, but whereas Dafoe's Elias still holds onto his\\nideals, Berenger's Barnes is ready and in reality rather willing to do\\nwhat it takes to finish the mission and survive.And from those story elements we end up getting a harrowing journey\\nthrough the battlefields, hardships, loss and Pyrrhic victories.\\nPlatoon shines because of its non-compromising tone, its actors, its\\nintensity and its vision to tell about the war through the eyes of\\nsomeone who's been there. It belongs to the elite of war movies for a\\nreason and is easily recommended.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI don\\'t usually like war movies, at all. Platoon was an unexpected\\nexception. Oliver Stone\\'s first of three Vietnam War films, for me it\\nreally came down to an educational expose of the psychological trauma\\nunique to war. With an all-star ensemble cast, the performances were\\nexceptional. From what I have read, this can be attributed to training\\nfrom a retired Marines Captain as well as director Oliver Stone\\'s\\npersonal history as a Vietnam soldier. I believe Platoon to be an\\naccurate representation of war on a micro scale, but not a macro one-\\nany and all of these events could have and probably did happen at some\\ntime during the war, but it is unlikely that this much could happen\\nbetween such a small number of men in such a short amount of time. The\\nprotagonist is played by none other than a young Charlie Sheen at his\\nprime. Taylor\\'s words of wisdom throughout the film are a testament to\\nthe long lasting effects of war. Veterans have a stereotype\\npersonality: more often than not, someone more logical than emotional;\\na lover of order, rules, and regimen; individuals willing to sacrifice\\nfor the greater good; a cool, collected, logical decision maker and\\nleader even under high-pressure circumstances. As with all stereotypes,\\nit is rooted in truth. Studies have shown that individuals attracted to\\nthe military tend to, overall, be a little less agreeable, extroverted,\\nand friendly than those who do not seek it out. One study in particular\\nfinds them to be \"more aggressive\", \"interested in competition rather\\nthan cooperation\", and \"less concerned about the feelings of others\".\\nThese particular personality traits, whereas obviously not so great for\\nromantic relationships or for forming lasting friendships, are often an\\nasset in career success. For example, these individuals are more likely\\nto make the difficult decisions sometimes necessary for success. Psychologists claim that our personalities do not change dramatically\\nover the course of our lifetime. Interestingly, the military is one of\\nthe only exceptions to this, as various research has shown. An\\nexception, though, that couldn\\'t be more understandable. After all,\\nwhat one experience is more immersive, uncompromising, and invasive? A\\nprominent aim of military training is to disseminate your\\npreconceptions, views, and outlook of the \"outside\" world. They want\\nto, literally, break you down and build you back up as a soldier. The\\naggression, the rules, the logical coolness of higher-ranking\\nofficials? Not only welcomed, but expected. If you cannot handle\\nyourself under pressure, cannot brace yourself for both physical and\\nemotional war, you will not survive training, let alone deployment.\\nIronic, then, isn\\'t it, that once a soldier signs his/her contract,\\nthey are bound to their word for the next several years? What if he\\nrealizes he is too sensitive? She realizes she hasn\\'t the strength,\\neither emotionally and/or physically? At some point, it\\'s just too damn\\nbad. In this way, individuals are often forced into an extreme\\nsituation; unexpected, life-altering, and personality-changing. After the all-immersive experience of military training, an individual\\nhas had to harden themselves even more; close off their emotions in\\norder to endure trying physical tests and emotional assault from all\\nangles. And if they are chosen to actually go to war? Well, I am\\ncertain that the personality shift will only be that much more\\ningrained. Once they return home, it\\'s easier said than done to just\\nsmoothly transition back to who they once were, how they once responded\\nand reacted to life. And Taylor is no exception to this. It has been a while since I felt so moved watching a film, in both\\npositive and negative ways. Scenes depicting the cold, ruthless killing\\nof others, friend or foe. Empathizing with soldiers wishing to be\\nkilled or injured in order to be sent home. Taylor trying to save some\\nyoung Vietnamese girls from being raped by his own men. Imagining the\\npsychological trauma of watching people you yelled at yesterday, got\\nhigh with last night, bonded with this morning, die in your arms. The\\npalpable loneliness of these men, writing home to their loved ones, or\\neven as they vie for the any emotionless type of physical intimacy.\\nWatching Taylor transform from a positive, optimistic young man wanting\\nto do the right thing for his country into an old soul, enervated and\\njaded, murder becoming a daily occurrence rather than the unbelievable\\nnightmare it should always be. In the penultimate scene before he is\\nrescued, Taylor serving personal justice in taking the life of the\\nheartless Staff Sargent Barnes. So, I wonder, is it any surprise that soldiers return home that much\\nmore emotionally closed off, their minds almost accustomed to the idea\\nof everyday trauma and constant panic, with an inability to open\\nthemselves up to others or allow themselves to succumb to emotional\\nweakness?\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThough I'm not a war movie fan, I thought Platoon was a solid film.Oliver Stone did a great job at directing, with perfect shots\\nespecially during the combat scenes. Great cast, but you can only\\nadmire Sheen's performance as the rest of the actors is a bit in the\\nbackground to me. Now on the other hand, I felt the movie could have\\nused some extra dynamic script-wise, because even though it is a good\\nstorytelling, it is a bit linear.I rated Platoon 7/10, because I'm not fond of war films, but I have to\\nadmit it is a solid one that conveys emotion especially through Sheen's\\ncharacter.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nPLATOON is a movie that didn't really impress me much when I first\\nwatched it, but I found that it grew on me after a few more viewings.\\nI've never been into war movies but there's always been something about\\nthe Vietnam War that grabbed my interest. It didn't play out like a\\nnormal war. It was deep in the jungle and the soldiers that experienced\\nit encountered more than your average wartime strain. The jungle is a\\nbeast all it's own and to find yourself battling in it's nightmare\\nterrain where the enemy can and will come from all sides at any moment\\nis terrifying. I love a good Vietnam War film, where the focus is on\\nthe experiences of the soldiers as opposed to achieving victory.\\nAPOCALYPSE NOW is one of my all-time favorite films period, and FULL\\nMETAL JACKET is an intense view of a soldier's life from boot camp\\nthrough the horrors of the war. So when I sat down to watch PLATOON, my\\nquestions was: how well did Oliver Stone's vision of the war stand up\\nto Coppola and Kubrick? PLATOON follows the experiences of one soldier,\\nChris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), as he arrives in Vietnam. An idealistic\\ncollege student, Chris believed it was everyone's duty, not just the\\npoor, to do their part in the war. Once he arrives, he discovers that\\nnobility doesn't even enter the picture. It's all about survival and\\nthe law of the jungle, and he's caught in the conflict between the\\ngung-ho Sergeant Barnes and the liberal Sergeant Elias.I suppose my initial disappointment with the movie was all a result of\\npersonal biases. At first glance, the movie wasn't as visually\\nimpressive as Kubrick's 'Nam, and especially not Coppola's. Coppola had\\nan incredible artistic vision when he created APOCALYPSE NOW. Every\\nscene, every shot, every line of dialogue in that movie is powerful (in\\nmy personal opinion, anyway). And Kubrick's film was brutal in how it\\ndepicted the dehumanization of soldier's in the war. Oliver Stone's\\nmovie didn't feel as artistically influenced. It had an almost generic\\nfeel to the movie from the very beginning with the jungle-green opening\\ncredits over the shot of a passenger/cargo plane dropping a batch of\\nfresh recruits in Vietnam. As I watched the film again, I found myself\\ndrawn into it's vision more and more. I still find Stone's vision less\\nvisually impressive than the others, but I am pulled in by the\\ncharacters of the film (more than Kubrick's at times). PLATOON is an\\nintense character piece where we experience the war through the eyes of\\nsomeone going into a nightmare situation without knowing what to expect\\n(just like the viewer). You sympathize with Chris and his comrades and\\nfeel the tension between the Elias and Barnes sides of the camp. You\\nwatch as Chris's idealism is slowly chipped away until there is nothing\\nleft but an almost feral nature and a code of honor when he seeks\\njustice for one of his fallen friends.My second problem with the film on its first viewing was the main\\ncharacter. I hadn't seen this movie until very recently, after the\\nwhole public meltdown of Charlie Sheen in the media. So my image of\\nCharlie Sheen is that of a bizarre tale of how celebrity life and eat\\nyour sanity. Watching him as a bright-eyed, optimistic private was a\\nhard pill to swallow. I just couldn't buy into it. I eventually\\novercame my views on Sheen and actually believe he did a better job\\nthan I originally gave him credit for. He's still a little hard to buy\\nin such a powerful dramatic role (I mean, he did do HOT SHOTS) but he\\nputs in a good performance. No where near as good as his father in\\nAPOCALYPSE NOW, but a good job regardless. There are actually a lot of\\ngreat performances here\\x85Keith David, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker,\\netc. I admit Dillon did feel a little over the top as Bunny, but he\\nremained in the realm of plausibility. You believe him as a someone who\\nwas probably a small-town jock back home but gets to stretch his legs a\\nbit and goes a little far with the freedom to act in Vietnam. Speaking\\nof over-the-top though, no one fits the bill better than John C.\\nMcGinley as O'Neill. It's OK though, because I've come to expect him to\\nham it up. The real powerhouses in the film are Willem Dafoe and Tom\\nBerenger as Sergeants Elias and Barnes. These man are the real center\\nof conflict in the picture. These two men have very different views on\\nrunning the war in Vietnam and it's their head-butting and eventual\\nconfrontation that drives Private Taylor's final descent into total\\nloss of innocence. It's truly a great story. Sure, I still don't\\nbelieve it rises to the ranks of Coppola and Kubrick, but I definitely\\ncount this as one of the most iconic visions of Vietnam to come out of\\nHollywood.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon is the film that not only put director Oliver Stone well and\\ntruly on the Hollywood map, its huge critical and commercial success\\nalso would set the Vietnam War film cycle into hyper-drive. It centres\\non a platoon on a tour of duty in Vietnam through the eyes of a young\\nrecruit who quit college to volunteer for active service. It is in\\nessence a combat film where the view is at ground level. In this sense\\nit mixes traditional gun battles with the smaller more personal details\\nthat show the discomfort of life in the jungle. Its approach was very\\nrealistic for its time and in some ways it did reinvent what a war film\\ncould be.While it does have many scenes of combat action, they are pretty messy\\nand unglorified and the film has a pretty clear anti-war message. This\\nis conveyed in quite a major way by how the platoon itself is\\nportrayed. It's divided into two camps led by two diametrically\\nopposite sergeants Barnes and Elias (Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe,\\nrespectively). The former is a facially scarred, violent man, while the\\nlatter is a morally sensitive borderline hippy. They show both sides of\\nthe American thinking about the war, with Barnes and his alcohol\\ndrinking followers the ugly brutal side of the coin and Elias and his\\nmarijuana smoking buddies the ones who question the participation of\\ntheir country. This dramatic tension is brought fully to the fore in\\nthe pivotal moment of the film where the platoon commit mass murder and\\nrape in a village, in a nod to arguably the most infamous real event in\\nthe war, a massacre at the village of Mai Lai in 1968.The dramatic conflict, while being the real meat of the film, does look\\nquite overly simplistically done to my eyes now, with the evil Barnes\\nand his bevvy merchant bad boys set against the hippy-like Elias and\\nhis chilled-out troops. It comes across as too black and white. It gets\\nthe message across but it does so with little subtlety or grey areas. I\\nthink Platoon overall, has aged a little worse than some of its\\ncontemporaries like Apocalypse Now (1979), Full Metal Jacket (1987) or\\nCasualties of War (1989). This is probably a lot to do with Stone's\\noverly politicised message, while the classical music which soundtracks\\nthe grimmest moments probably felt original at the time but now almost\\ncomes across as, dare I say it, a little cheesy. The film benefits\\nsomewhat from having quite a good cast, some of whom are actors who\\nwould go onto big careers, although in truth future mega star Johnny\\nDepp makes absolutely no impression whatsoever in his minor role as a\\ntranslator.All-in-all, Platoon is still an impressive combat film but it's one\\nwhich for me has not aged too great in other ways. It still has\\nhistorical importance as a key entry in the sub-genre though.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nOliver Stone's 'Platoon', which he wrote and directed, is partly based\\non his own experiences in Vietnam. Our protagonist, Chris (Charlie\\nSheen) is an idealized kid from a privileged family who feels it is his\\npatriotic duty to enlist, and therefore is one of the lone volunteers\\nin his platoon, headed by the badass Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes. (Tom\\nBerenger, looking even more badass with a deep gash in his face that\\nruns from forehead to chin) Somewhat acting as Chris' mentor is Sgt.\\nElias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), and the two provide (in the most\\nrudimentary sense) good and evil influences as Chris experiences the\\nevery day horrors in the jungles of Vietnam; from the irritating \\x96\\nbugs, inclement weather, to the terrifying \\x96 combat with the Vietcong,\\nto the gut-wrenching \\x96 the ruin of a Vietnam village, mostly innocents.I thought that 'Platoon' was a good film \\x96 it is obviously a film made\\nbefore Stone's highly stylistic period (which he still appears to be\\nin), and is instead a fairly straightforward film about the horrors of\\nwar. Sheen was decent as Chris; he managed to believably convey\\ninnocence as well as hardness without falling into clich\\xe9. Berenger was\\npretty brutal as Barnes, but it was Dafoe who I was most impressed\\nwith, (though his talent is obvious throughout his many roles, he still\\nhas the ability to amaze me. This was obviously a very personal film\\nfor Stone, and I think that he conveyed his message of 'War is hell',\\n'War kill innocence' effectively. There were some moments where I was incredibly disturbed, mainly the\\nscene in the village. I found that I couldn't stop crying during this\\nscene because it was just so terrifying, and unfortunately very true.\\n'Platoon' doesn't give us any new insights on war, but it also doesn't\\nprescribe to clich\\xe9s either. It is a solid and well-done film that does\\nnot glorify the war experience, nor does it preach. I would certainly\\nrecommend this film to any war-film lover, but it also has enough of a\\nstoryline to hold the attention of most other film lovers as well.--Shel\\n\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nSpoilers Ahead:The first thing is the realistic dialog that Stone is famous for in all\\nof his movies. From the first frame, the abuse hurled upon the \\'candy\\nass cherries\\', the open contempt the veterans have for Chris and\\nGardner is so authentic. With the exception of Elias, nobody could care\\nless if they live or die. This is Sheen\\'s first awakening. When you\\nwatch the movie, the closing narration really is the movie. Chris was\\nthe child of two fathers. His weeping at the end, on the helicopter,\\nwas his guilt at becoming Barnes to kill Barnes. A tiny bit of Barnes\\nwent inside of him against his will. The movie is frank in its openness\\nabout the rampant drug use by the troops in Vietnam, quite a verboten\\nsubject before this film. The movie can be summed up in one word:\\ndisillusionment. Chris arrives full of enthusiasm believing in the war\\npropaganda he was fed in the safe world of middle America. Once he\\narrives, the down-slope begins. It is important to notice that Stone\\nbalances the American atrocity with an earlier one by the VC, a feature\\noften missed by those who attack the movie. The VC disembowel and\\nstring up a straggling soldier that triggers Barnes\\' mission of\\nretribution. The social group is so accurate, it even has the requisite\\nbrown-noser found in every working or social group. McGinley renders an\\nexcellent toady to Barnes as O\\' Neil. The horror and chaos that is combat is transferred well here. The\\nterror, bravery, cowardice and nobility all blend in a realistic battle\\nat the end. The acting is excellent across the entire cast way into the\\nvery back with Keith David stealing the movie. My favorite scene is\\nwhere King has to explain to quixotic Chris that, no, they don\\'t amount\\nto anything in this world. He has such a look of sorrow upon his\\nface,\"Who the Hell ever said we did man?\" The attack upon Elias\\' murder\\nat Barnes\\' hands misses the Christ symbolism which was attacked when\\nthis was released. Those who miss the allegorical point are irritated\\nat how many rounds he absorbs. Watch when he dies how he lifts his arms\\nup in a crucified pose; this was the point Stone was making with Elias.\\nTo make it clear we have Barnes highlighting it,\"Elias is a water\\nwalker.\" This existential tug of war for possession of Chris\\' soul is\\nthe Vietnam War\\'s political argument distilled from the macro to the\\nmicro level. Elias foretells the conclusion,\"We\\'re going to lose this\\nwar.\" Barnes is like Curtiz in Apocalypse Now, he is willing to win at\\nall costs no matter the barbarity that must be used to attain the goal.I recommend the movie to you as an experience that all great war movies\\nalways are. It is quite evocative of Wise\\'s Sand Pebbles where, again,\\nthe motif is disillusionment. In both movies, you are drawn into the\\nmovie by the great writing, the powerful acting and the painful\\nverisimilitude. These are not cartoon cutouts, even Barnes has\\nadmirable aspects to his personality. His criticisms of Elias are not\\nwithout merit from a certain point of view. The reality of the by-play,\\nthe college Lieutenant in over his head killing his own men with his\\nretarded fire mission, the religious soldier using it for comfort, the\\nindifference of upper command to the mens\\' lives in the final battle:\\nthese are what make it great. Featuring stunning photography, deeply\\npensive music and a view into the Stygian Night that is war. My\\nfavorite performances are the supporting actors: David, Whitaker,\\nMcGinley, that tells you how good the acting in this movie is. The two\\nsides of human nature are rendered so well with the compassionate Elias\\nand the ruthless Barnes. Chris is caught within the middle trying to\\nhold onto his humanity under the worst of tests. Yes, it is dark and\\ndepressing with some truly horrific images. The battle for Taylor\\'s\\nSpirit is the battle we all fight every day of our lives. Yes, We Can\\nBut Hope To Find Some Hope And Beauty To The Rest Of Our Lives. Oliver\\nStone\\'s Masterpiece. May You Win Your Battle Also, My Friends. Q.E.D.\\n',\n",

I have to confess that I didn\\'t stay and came back\\nhome, but my brother have a breed in America and my nephew is an\\nAmerican. Those young people have to know, but unfortunately I can\\'t\\nspeak to Sam very often.The Vietnamese population are Buddhist by religion. Almost 90% of those\\nare dumb found. They didn\\'t understood that War Inc. was imposed on\\nthem by Great Powers. Soviet Union and Communist China did well in\\nVietnam, they dragged the Americans for whole 10 years and bleeded them\\n50 000 troopers. More were lost as P.O.W. and no one can figure the\\nexact number. Total deployment of U.S.A. and Allies were 500 000\\nsoldiers. My personal opinion is that drafting procedure was a total\\nshame - what do you mean by every odd number in Birth Certificate\\nbecoming a conscript. Else, many people doved.A share in documentary literature are the, so called, \"Pentagon Papers\"\\non United States Vietnam Relations 1945-1967.

       " u\"\\nOf all the war movies I've seen, this is probably one of the most\\nhonest and non-romantic depictions of the 20th centuries longest war\\nI've seen. Its a hard movie to watch but its meant to be as it shows\\nthe war for the hell it really was, its authenticity cannot be praised\\nenough thanks to Oliver Stone's personal experiences that he went\\nthrough when serving in the war. The actors put themselves through a\\ntough boot-camp in order for an accurate portrayal and it showed, they\\ndidn't have to act exhausted and weary as they genuinely were. Charlie\\nSheen's depiction as the naive bright eyed college kid who joined up\\nfor romantic reasons, but quickly learns the harsh realities of the war\\nis one of the more memorable. likewise Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe as\\ntwo battle hardened but morally very different veterans are also very\\nmemorable. The fighting and battle scenes again are unforgettable and\\naccurate and the show just what the American solders were up against\\nand how slippery and how hard the NVA and the VC could be to pin down.\\nOne aspect of the movie which I found refreshing was it didn't attempt\\nto picture the Americans as angels, it showed that they could be no\\nbetter or sometimes worse than the enemy they were fighting. Now in\\ncomparison with Full Metal Jacket, this movie is no better or worse, as\\nit depicts a different aspect of the war than this movie, this movie\\ndepicts the type of fighting the soldiers had to do before the Tet\\nOffensive, jungle warfare, where-as Full Metal Jacket depicted urban\\nwarfare in the Tet Offensive. So if you want an non-sugar coated,\\naccurate and authentic portrayal of the Vietnam war, then this movie is\\nfor you.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThe Vietnam War is a conflict that garnered tremendous controversy as\\nmany condemned the war as a futile and lead to what people called\\nneedless lost of thousands of American lives. The purpose of the war\\nwas to the fight against communism, a long going threat occurring\\nduring the decades of the Cold War. Director Oliver Stone who was a\\nVietnamese War veteran himself makes a brutal, but utterly effective\\nportrayal in this war drama based on his experiences in the Vietnamese\\nbattlefields. Charlie Sheen plays Chris Taylor, a young man in his late\\nteens who drops out of college and voluntary for active duty in\\nVietnam. With no combat experience compared to the other men in his\\nplatoon including the hot-tempered Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes (played\\nby Tom Berenger), the more kind- heart Sergeant Elias (played by\\nWilliam Defoe), the aggressive and ruthless Lieutenant Wolfe (played by\\nMark Moses), and fellow African-American Big Harold (played by Forest\\nWhitaker); Chris faces the dehumanizing effects of the war and the\\nmoral dilemmas of men in active combat as the platoon fight their\\nthrough the grueling environment and atmosphere of the Vietnamese\\nbattle front.War is ugly, and this movie certainly shows it. Shooting the film in\\nthe Phillipines which serves as an authentic backdrop of wartime\\nVietnam, Oliver Stone uses his experiences in active combat and puts\\ninto grueling prospective, giving viewers on a haunting and gritty\\ntaste of the horrors and atrocities that ignited during the years of\\nactive duty in Vietnam. From the bloody and gruesome combat sequences,\\nto the deteriorating psychological health of the fellow soldiers, to\\nthe loss of innocence in humanity in the characters; Oliver Stone pulls\\nno punches when expressing the reality of what the deadly conflict\\noverseas was like with convicted realism and powerful emotions. One\\nscene in particular features a raid in the Vietnamese village where\\nmembers of the platoon, Lieutenant Wolfe in particular torture innocent\\ncivilians and the way they treat these civilians is an eye-sore and\\nquite unsettling to watch. Most importantly, it shows the psychological\\nimpact on Charlie Sheen's character and his fellow comrades and they\\nbecome robbed of their moral compass. It is a real powerful issue that\\ngoes on in active combat today, soldiers overseas are pitted with not\\nonly their desperate feat to survive and protect their country but\\ndealing with their ethical sense. The story focuses not exactly active\\ncombat itself but the effects it has the soldiers, and the story\\nprogresses through how the main character changes as person, a\\ncharacter who you come to care about. Charlie Sheen gives an incredible\\nperformance, easily one of the best if not the best roles in his\\ncareer. And let's not forget William Defoe, an actor who isn't well\\nknown for placing good guy roles, yet manages to show pure charisma and\\nhumanity in his character; and Tom Berenger as Sergeant Barnes, a\\nsoldier with a cold heart against the both his comrades and the\\nVietnamese.Platoon is brutal, violent, and quite disturbing to sit through, but it\\nis very effective and honest in portraying the horrors of the Vietnam\\nWar. Oliver Stone does a tremendous job on capturing the brutality of\\nthe hellish environment of active combat. His directorial efforts pay\\noff and the cast is outstanding. This movie would make a great pick for\\nanyone in the mood of a powerful war flick.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThere are no grandstanding heroics in Oliver Stone\\'s \\'Platoon\\'. No\\nback-patting reassurances that the Vietnam War was ever remotely\\nconsidered a noble cause. This film is an act of courage. Stone, the\\ngutsy writer-director, records in a devastating barrage of images the\\nrelentless horror and the senseless carnage experienced by far too many\\nAmericans in Vietnam. The movie is, in fact, so emotionally powerful\\nthat you can practically feel the same gnawing fear that can bring out\\nthe savagery in the most decent young men. Platoon, to a large extent,\\nis a replay of his own harrowing, wartime experiences - Stone was a\\nmedal-decorated former \"grunt\" who served with the 25th Infantry in\\nVietnam.From the very first shot - where newly arrived troops recoil at the\\nsight of body bags being loaded onto their returning plane - you plunge\\ndirectly into a blazing jungle inferno. The film is structured as a\\nDantesque descent into hell, following the progress of a young foot\\nsoldier, Chris Taylor (a commendable Charlie Sheen), as he penetrates\\nfurther and further into the blind terror that is his experience of the\\nwar. Chris, as Stone himself was, is a well-to-do college dropout who\\nvolunteered for Vietnam out of a sense of patriotism and a vague desire\\nto prove himself as a man. He\\'s expecting a WWII movie; what he finds\\ninstead is a nightmare. It\\'s a war where there seems to be no master\\nplan, no big picture and no advances. There is only terror, bone-deep\\nexhaustion, nighttime patrols and the humid jungle, crawling with\\nsnakes, insects and the silent Viet Cong. This is, unquestionably, what\\nVietnam must have felt like to the foot soldiers.The movie, with its hallucinatory, nightmarish visual quality, captures\\nthe moral confusion and the increasing disintegration of soldiers who\\nescape by getting stoned together. This mercilessly intense movie is\\ndefinitely not for the faint of heart. The atmosphere remains highly\\ncharged from beginning to end. There\\'s no letup, nary a suggestion of\\nhumor to break the tension. It\\'s not unlike an Indonesian shadow play\\nin the sense that the evil god, scar-faced Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger,\\nhis face a road-map of scars, extremely dynamic as the fighting\\nmachine), collides head-on with his moral pole- a heroic God fearing\\nman, the disillusioned Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe making a strong\\nimpression). There are images in Platoon so powerful that they seem,\\nrather than simply imprinted on celluloid, to have been burned into\\nmemory. This bold combat movie projects Vietnam with such ferocity that\\nno one can ever doubt that that war was indeed anything but a living\\nhell.Decades later, Platoon remains an intriguing blend of the political and\\nthe personal, with Stone turning his memories and his opinions about\\nVietnam into a potent drama. Platoon continues to be lauded as a film\\nof inspiring empathy and implacable force!\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon is often cited as one of the most realistic war films ever\\nmade. It's about the true experiences Oliver Stone had in the Vietnam\\nwar. It shows war on different levels including men from the same side\\nturning on each other. It has a lot of power because of this and it\\ngives it an emotional aspect. This movie has a lot of heavy material\\nand is sometimes hard to watch at times. The violent battles show the\\nsoldiers getting transformed into killing machines after many\\nfrightening experiences and close calls they have. The movie both looks\\nand sounds amazing. I really like the film's score. When it's played,\\nit really helps us get immersed in the scenes due to the notes and\\nbeats in it. Sure, some of their choices of actors are a bit\\nquestionable like putting Charlie Sheen in an emotional role but I\\ndidn't seem to mind it that much because they played the roles with\\nsuch great emotion and power that it didn't seem to bother me. This is\\na great war film and it will be remembered throughout the ages. It's\\nunforgettable, violent, sad, and moving.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nYes, it was the Vietnam movie, in a trilogy of three, ala 1987. What I\\nread about it, and seen briefly through, clips, yet when I went into\\nthe cinema, I still yet was disappointed, but respectfully it is a\\ngreat film. I just expected more realism, I guess. The opening is\\nhaunting, and leaves an imprint in the memory for those who would of\\nseen it. Told through the eyes, of a school dropout Chris Taylor\\n(Sheen, very good), who sighed up for the Nam, we follow his eye\\nopening journey of hell, how with fresh eyes, how it perceived, the\\nterror of Vietnam, no holds barred. Granted, there are some really\\ntense moments in Platoon, concerning Charlie, the enemy, one\\nindisputably tensely charged scene, with Sheen on watch, where he's in\\nclose proximity of them. Another scary moment had a gentle humble,\\nSergeant Elias, wonderfully played by Dafoe in still one of his best\\nperformances, going into a bunker underneath which is like cavern where\\nhe explores it, with a little bit of company. Of course, it's\\nBerenger's show in the life of the story and his performance, as stout\\nhearted and uncompromising Barnes, the head Sergeant, running the other\\nplatoon, where he butts heads a lot with adversary Dafoe, and in one\\nshocking moment towards the end, Not only with this whole outfit\\nfighting the enemy, both platoons are fighting each other. I couldn't\\nstands Barnes's platoon, that partly consists, of a fawning type, John\\nMcginley who went on to become a very and sought after commodity as\\ncharacter actor, while Kevin's Dillon's borderline psychotic Bunny,\\nwill live on in my mind, probably, secretly, one of the film's best\\nperformances. As in Casualties Of War the death of innocents related to\\nthe enemy are again, sickeningly disregarding, as in court marshaling,\\nbrushed under the carpet stuff. Ironically the same actor who sided\\nwith Penn and his boys, in this, he's the other way intent, on seeing,\\nthis unlawful killing by Barnes goes to trial, if proved. The scene\\nwith Bunny in the tent, was sickening, though the violence was implicit\\nhere, where he was smashing the brains of a gook civilian's head in\\nwith the butt of his rival, splots of blood, staining Bunny's face.\\nPlatoon, with a crafted script by Stone and A grade performances by\\nit's actors, is a film to see cinematocally, the photography is\\nexcellent and does work. May'be I really got carried with the realism\\naspect of the film, but it's still a pretty real and effective that\\nwill scar the memory years after seeing it. For a war film, trying to\\nwin an Oscar as best film, is war itself. This was one that did.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nPlatoon is clearly one of director Oliver Stone\\'s most inspired films.\\nStone volunteered for the army in 1967 as a college drop-out. He wrote\\nthe screenplay for Platoon in 1975 but it took over ten years until he\\nwas able to film it. What separates Platoon from other American films\\ndealing with the Vietnam War is that it depicts wartime massacres.\\nFilms before that, like The Deer Hunter (1978) and Apocalypse Now\\n(1979), only focused on the shattered psyches produced by the war. Keep\\nin mind though that Platoon is a mainstream movie, so it doesn\\'t come\\nanywhere near the brutality that the Americans sometimes demonstrated.\\nThe 1968 My Lai Massacre, in which as many as 504 unarmed civilians\\nwere killed, is just one of many examples. The Vietnam War is\\nconsidered to be the greatest trauma of 20th century American history,\\nbut a few decades later the USA savagely attacked Yugoslavia and Iraq.\\nPlatoon made a lot of money at the box office, mainly because Stone has\\nthe ability to make a film entertaining no matter what it\\'s about. The\\nfilm\\'s partial blindness to the war was another reason for its success.\\nIt\\'s not made clear who the American soldiers are actually fighting and\\nwhy they invaded Vietnam in the first place. Let\\'s also not forget that\\nStone dedicated the film to the men who lost their lives. So, when\\nStone is accused by some people of being anti-American or a leftie I\\ncan just laugh at their foolishness. What\\'s most interesting about\\nPlatoon for me is that Stone brought his own experience of being a\\nsoldier in Vietnam. When Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) said that you\\ndon\\'t really sleep even when you do get time to sleep I was immediately\\nreminded of what my father told me. My father served in the army. Even\\nthough he didn\\'t see combat he told me that he still stayed awake. In\\nPlatoon Stone looks at the war from his educated middle-class point of\\nview. He shows the behavior of under-privileged blacks and of \"white\\ntrash\" from middle America. Stone\\'s direction is very good, so it\\'s not\\na surprise that he won an Oscar. With cinematographer Robert Richardson\\nhe managed to capture some impressive images. He also brought\\nintelligence to the film by depicting a war between two sergeants,\\nBarnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe). It\\'s pretty much Jesus\\n(Elias) fighting against the covetous shadow of the American dream\\n(Barnes). The performances by most of the cast are very good. Berenger\\nand Dafoe are terrific. They\\'re clearly the standouts. Historian\\nCarroll Quigley thought that what happened to Western civilization in\\nthe first half of the 20th century was a tragedy. It\\'s clear why. There\\nwere two big wars, a depression, and the coming of fascism. In addition\\nto that the Russians foiled the plans of the Germans and the British\\nand captured Eastern Europe. Yet Quigley still had hope when he wrote\\nhis famous book in the 1960s. But, as the Vietnam War dragged on, he\\nbegan to lose this hope. He began to think that Western civilization is\\nnearly finished. I think that there\\'s still hope for Western\\ncivilization, though the Vietnam War was yet another example of the\\ncrisis that this society is going through. Platoon isn\\'t my favorite\\nwar movie. I like Come And See (1985) and Apocalypse Now (1979) more,\\nbut I easily recommend Platoon too.\\n',\n",

I wasn\\'t even born yet so I\\'m not going to sit here and say\\nwhich film most realistically captured the war but when I hear people\\nsay this is the closest it\\'s easy to see why.

       " u'\\nOliver Stone, Platoon was name a \"masterpiece\" and one of the most\\nrealistic Vietnam war movies of all times.I did enjoy the village scene showing how crazy yanks are at yielding\\ntheir way to scared the populations.Charlie Sheen memorable motto \"They\\'re just humans being...\"man, showed\\nwhat wars movie is all about.Charlie\\'s great and all, but Platoon\\'s thrill is in its supporting\\ncast, namely Tom Berenger as a rather evil yet invincible Staff\\nSargeant, and Willem Dafoe as the unforgettably moral Sargeant Elias.\\nWhen Berenger and Elias spar, it\\'s epic acting -- and as Stone details\\non a commentary track, it\\'s a bit ironic since up until this film,\\nBerenger had always played good guys (a la The Big Chill) and Dafoe had\\nalways played terrorists. Dafoe, of course, would go on to play Jesus\\nChrist.Highly recommended as one of Stone\\'s greatest works.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nRecently, over the last few days, I will have commented on a\\ntriumvirate of Oliver Stone movies. \"Platoon\" is considered his\\ngreatest movie ever!! I thought it was extremely compelling!!!\\n\"Platoon\" won the academy award for best picture in 1986, and, Oliver\\nStone won for best director for this film that year as well!! I would\\nhave to say that my favorite Oliver Stone film is \"Talk Radio\"... With\\nregard to all of Oliver Stone\\'s movies, \"Platoon\" is the most\\ncritically acclaimed, hence, this is his trophy!! \"Platoon\" deals with\\nthe laborious tragedies of the Vietnam War, and how one horrifying\\nconundrum had the ability to vitiate so many soldier\\'s sense of\\nnaivety!! While the vast majority of Americans were reticent to\\ncriticize the United States involvement in Vietnam, they also did not\\nhave the clairvoyance to envision the idea of how we as a nation would\\nget so involved with such a sustained and prolonged occupation in this\\narchaic nation (Vietnam) either!! The precarious political agenda of\\nour constituency on Capital Hill cultivated an intransigence with\\nworldwide decorum, as well as with the wishes of the American people!!\\nThis movie is an incredibly astute depiction of how some young soldiers\\nbecame victims of congressional blundering!! A war should be fought for\\nnational cause and not for political agreement!!! The movie \"Platoon\"\\narticulates an uncanny ability to purvey a moral dissonance with the\\nunfortunate plight of so many Americans during the Vietnam War!! Oliver\\nStone is once again very cunningly successful at depicting human\\natrocity to it\\'s ultimately dire and absolutely abhorrent level of\\nsocially conscious pitfalls!! The acting in this movie is spectacular,\\nthe actors include, Tom Berrenger, Charles Sheen, Johnny Depp, and John\\nMcGinley!! AFI ranks \"Platoon\" as one of the top 100 movies ever made\\nin the American cinema world, and, this website ranks it amongst the\\ntop 250!! YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!! IT IS FABULOUS!!!!\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nDid Platoon actually win Best Picture? Please tell it didn\\'t because if so,\\nHOW BAD WAS EVERYTHING ELSE RELEASED THAT YEAR? This film is the epitome of\\na sub-par movie and I practically feel as though I\\'m being polite for saying\\nso, considering the numerous flaws this one has. The acting is okay, but\\nnothing more than that, the characters are dull and the \"heroes\" are beyond\\nnon-sympathetic, the script lacks depth, and the ending is terrible. Why\\npeople can pan a fine movie like \"Limbo\" for its ending and not this is\\nbeyond me. I\\'ve never seen such a terrible message given, but what can you\\nexpect from a movie where the heroes bond during a big drug circle? Even the\\nfilm\\'s one really good scene(where they\\'re in Vietnam and freakishly\\nshooting just about anybody) literally goes nowhere. I think it was merely\\nsupposed to reflect the \\'goodness\\' of Captian Elias and the monstrosity of\\nTom Berenger(pathetically the most interesting character), or something, but\\nwho knows, considering nobody in the movie is even mentioning anything about\\nit 10 minutes after it happened, though one would have thought it was\\nsupposed to be a great plot twist? That, along with a \"shocking\" scene where\\na helicophter flies away, leaving an important character behind(so\\nridiculously done that I couldn\\'t help laughing aloud)and this is real \"Best\\nPicture\" fair alright. What a taint to the Academy Awards.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\"Platoon\" is hardly an obscure movie, and I guess the reason it\\'s taken\\nme so many years to finally see this is - I dunno, you see enough war\\nmovies over the years (not to mention having seen \"Full Metal Jacket\"),\\nhow affecting could this actually be? That\\'s a stupid reason, and the\\njoke\\'s on me; \"Platoon\" is devastating. This is probably as anti-war as\\nthey come, and that it\\'s partly somewhat autobiographical just gives it\\nmore punch.I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen a movie of this type that really\\nemphasizes the dehumanizing effects of war. Charlie Sheen\\'s fall from\\nwide-eyed grace isn\\'t so much heartbreaking as it is tremendously\\ndispiriting. And putting him between two opposing symbols of embittered\\nsoldier (Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger) makes for a clever storytelling\\nhook. I really don\\'t want to give away any spoilers, but when one of\\nthese lead actors is killed, it is deeply sad.This one absolutely lives up to the hype.9/10\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nPlatoon is one of the most realistic war films already made \\u200b\\u200b, is the\\nkind of film that have neither protagonist ( Charlie Sheen may be even\\nconsidered a protagonist, more in my opinion there is no ), the\\ndirection of Oliver Stone is very good, cast is very good, Charlie\\nSheen , Willem Dafoe , Forest Whitaker , John C. McGinley , Kevin\\nDillon and even one participation of Johnny Depp , the soundtrack is\\nexcellent , especially that is played at the opening of the film,\\nexcellent theme, the picture is very good, the costumes are good, the\\nfilm is realistic in showing the terror of war , especially in the\\nscene of the village of Vietnamese , the script is good, have catchy\\nphrases and striking scenes , Platoon is perhaps the best already war\\nfilm made it has striking scenes , very good performances , and shows\\nvery competently the terror of war . Note 9.5\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI have seen many movies over the years however the epic war drama\\n\"Platoon\" is by far my favorite for many reasons. The cast is somehow\\nperfect for each of their roles, evoking strong emotional responses at\\nevery turn. \"Platoon\" also does a fantastic job showing the horrors of\\nthe Vietnam War through a moving plot, clear internal struggle, a dark\\ncolor scheme, and the utilization of heart wrenching music like the\\nAdagio for the Strings. This film is also excellent on a much deeper,\\nmetaphorical level. Upon multiple viewings, it becomes apparent that\\nElias represents Jesus Christ (good) and Barnes represents Satan (evil)\\nwhich creates a whole new level of interest in the film. Even after\\nwatching it a hundred times, I still find myself moved by the powerful,\\nundeniably beautiful work of art that is \"Platoon\".\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nGreetings from Lithuania.\"Platoon\" (1986) is without a doubt Oliver Stone\\'s best film. It\\'s\\neasily the most accurate Vietnam War movie ever made, and one of a few\\nbest. Fighting sequences are done in a way like you are always in the center\\nof fight, rather just watching it from outside. There are many good\\nactors here, and all of them did a great job. Directing is also\\nterrific - it\\'s definitely directors most straightforward movie,\\nwithout all the fancy or stylized editing - it\\'s just a great film\\nmaking on all accounts.Overall, \"Platoon\" is a great war movie and one the few best in it\\'s\\ngenre. Craftmenship is terrific - once seen this movie is impossible to\\nforget one. A true classic.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nSuperb.1967. A fresh-out-of-training recruit, Chris (played by Charlie Sheen),\\narrives in Vietnam and within days is out on patrol in the jungle. His\\nplatoon sergeant, Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), is\\ntough-as-nails and a hard taskmaster. His squad leader, Sergeant Elias\\n(Willem Dafoe), cares for his men and tries to help Chris learn and\\nsurvive. Unfortunately, an incident occurs which sets Barnes against\\nElias and causes a large amount of friction within the platoon. This,\\nand they still have to fight the Viet Cong...One of the greatest war movies ever made. Certainly in my top 3 Vietnam\\nwar movies (the other two being Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket).\\nIncredibly gritty and realistic, with a great sense of what those that\\nfought in Vietnam it went though. A good examination of the morality of\\nwar and how war changes people, especially in the heat of battle.Deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar in 1987 with Oliver Stone picking\\nup Best Director. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger got Best Supporting\\nActor nominations.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nPlatoon is a 1986 American war film written and directed by Oliver\\nStone one of the most strongest realistic anti war films of all time.\\nIt is one of the best Vietnam war films I have ever seen that won the\\nAcademy Award for Best Picture of 1986 and best Director for Oliver\\nStone, as well as Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing. Stone\\'s\\nVietnam film portrayed a real life human been on his point of view of\\nthe story telling that went on in his real life that he experienced\\nafter his tour of duty in Vietnam ended in 1968, Oliver Stone wrote a\\nscreenplay called Break: a semi-autobiographical account detailing his\\nexperiences and the life he was in Vietnam. The characters were\\nportrayed more then a few soldiers they were portrayed more as a human\\nbeen than been soldiers obeying an order.Platoon shows the Vietnam War\\nwas a big mistake, but being a fictional documentary on Vietnam is far\\nfrom its purpose.Those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach\\nto others what we know, and to try with what\\'s left of our lives to\\nfind a goodness and meaning in this life. In Platoon, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a young, naive U.S. soldier\\nwho, upon his arrival to Vietnam, quickly discovers that he must do\\nbattle not only with the Viet Cong, but also with the gnawing fear,\\nphysical exhaustion and intense anger growing within him. While his two\\ncommanding officers draw a fine line between the war they wage against\\nthe enemy and the one they fight with each other, the conflict, chaos\\nand hatred permeate Taylor, suffocating his realities and numbing his\\nfeelings to man\\'s highest value... life.Chris sees his platoon fragmented into two halves, each aligned with\\none of two men -- Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom\\nBerenger). Those two soldiers are really two positive good things to\\nsee in the film because it sets the viewer on the seat of the edge.\\nThey both have nominally the same enemy (Viet Cong), but, really, it\\ndoesn\\'t take long to realize that Elias is Good, and Barnes is Evil\\n(the \"enemy\" does not enter into the moral equation of this film, at\\nall it\\'s an outside threat, same as malaria-carrying mosquitoes or even\\nfriendly fire). Elias feels the futility of the war and has respect for\\nlife; Barnes fights the war doggedly and has no compassion, period.\\nBoth are efficient soldiers fighting the same enemy, but really as is\\nat one point aptly put by Chris Taylor himself,they are fighting for\\nthe souls of the platoon members, as the outcome of the war is never\\nreally in doubt.The platoon reaches the village, where a food and weapons cache is\\ndiscovered. While questioning the village chief, Barnes loses his\\npatience and senselessly kills the man\\'s wife despite his denials that\\nthey are aiding the Viet Cong. Barnes is about to murder the man\\'s\\nyoung daughter to force him to tell them to where the enemy is. Elias doesn\\'t take kindly to this kind of behavior. Elias and Barnes\\ncome closer and closer to open conflict, as Taylor becomes a veteran,\\nobviously siding with Elias. Meanwhile, the fate of the platoon comes\\ncloser and closer to them, culminating in an explosively shot action\\nconclusion. The end is dark, but morally satisfying.Platoon is a legendary film. A film that I will always cherish, and a\\nfilm that I will never get tired of. And the last Vietnam film worth a\\ndamn to watch. There isn\\'t any War film today that was filmed as really\\nhuman drama war today in 2015. It respectively represents the very\\nessence of purposefully haunting powerful cinematography in the\\nhistory.-- It is representing admirable cinematic craftsmanship and\\nstorytelling. A film that is sometimes impossible to watch for its\\nfrighteningly intense and emotionally draining account of the Vietnam\\nWar as it is waged both on the battlefields and within the very souls\\nof men.The best real human drama portrayed on screen anti-war film in Vietnam\\nfrom the 80\\'s, It is my favorite film that I will always love to death\\nto see. I also don\\'t watch this film for an action ; I actually see it\\nfor the war and how it everything was, what is more valuable and it is\\nlife: The film also have a message in it. The actors portraying the\\ncharacters did make a believable performance as the real team of squad\\nsoldier fighting the Enemy the Viet Cong.The battles with Viet-Cong are shown realistic mostly on the end of the\\nfinal battle. 10/10 Score: A+: Orion Pictures Starring: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe\\nand Charlie Sheen.

       " u\"\\nThis film follows Chris Taylor from the moment he arrives in Vietnam\\nuntil he leaves. He was a college student, so didn't have to fight, but\\nhe thought it was wrong that it was the poor kids being forced to serve\\nso he enlisted\\x85 it isn't long before he questions that decision. Nobody\\nwants to know the new guys and they are seen not to matter. As time\\npasses he becomes accepted in the group but at the same time it becomes\\nclear that there are deep divisions within the platoon with those half\\nbehind Sgt Barnes, the brutal but effective platoon leader, and half\\nbehind the more sympathetic Sgt Elias; these tensions deepen when Elias\\nreports Barnes for a war crime committed in a Vietnamese village;\\nTaylor will have to choose his side if he is to survive the conflict\\nbetween the two sergeants as well as numerous fights with the North\\nVietnamese Army.Writer/director Oliver Stone isn't trying to explain the war; he is\\ntrying to show us the war from the point of view of ordinary infantry\\nsoldiers\\x85 the generals may be fighting for an overall cause but these\\npoor grunts are just trying to survive their year in Vietnam. He\\nbrilliantly captures the fear and confusion of war in the jungle where\\none moment soldiers are worrying about insect bites and the next they\\nare in a fire fight. These fights aren't shown as exciting; they are\\nconfused and bloody and when people are hit they are shown to suffer\\nrather than dying silently. The film doesn't shy away from showing the\\ndark side of war as we see soldiers murdering Vietnamese civilians. The\\ndivision within the platoon seems like a metaphor for the divided\\nopinions of people about the war at the time. The cast does a great\\njob; Charlie Sheen puts in his best performance as Taylor; our guide to\\nthe life of US soldiers in that war. Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe also\\nexcel as Sgts Barnes and Elias; the former is particularly frightening\\nas a character who is almost evil incarnate at times yet at others\\nseems like the man who is keeping his platoon alive. The rest of the\\ncast, which includes several people who went onto bigger roles, do a\\nfine job making all the varied characters believable. Overall I'd\\ncertainly recommend this to anybody interesting in films about war;\\njust don't expect gung-ho excitement; this is gut-wrenching and very\\ntense\\x85 and if you enjoyed this check out the less well known 'Hamburger\\nHill'.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\"I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy; we fought\\nourselves. And the enemy was in us.\"If all war films were as good and sincere as Platoon it would probably\\nbe one of my favorite genres, but there are very few exceptions where\\nthe material is treated right as most directors tend to either be\\nincredibly biased debating either in favor or against the war. It\\'s\\nstrange I make this claim since Platoon is obviously an anti-war film,\\nbut it treats the material with an honesty you don\\'t find in other\\nfilms of the genre. It is much easier to make a statement like this in\\na war that everyone considers was a terrible mistake to get into. What\\nPlatoon has going for it however, is that it was written and directed\\nby a man who actually served in the Vietnam War and decided to share\\nhis experience of what really was going on. Oliver Stone handles the\\nmaterial with incredible honesty not shying away from the horrors and\\nsenseless deaths in war and he delivers a film that never feels\\nsermonizing (with a few exceptions). Even the villains (not the Vietnam\\nsoldiers, but the dubious Sgt. Barnes and his band of brothers) are\\nportrayed with some sort of empathy. Platoon isn\\'t actually a film that\\nfocuses on war between Vietnamese and American soldiers, but rather the\\ncivil war that was going on inside the mind of these soldiers that\\nStone fought alongside with. He wasn\\'t afraid at pointing out who the\\nreal enemy truly was and for that reason the Vietnamese soldiers are\\nbarely portrayed in this film. It seems that with Platoon, Stone was\\nable to cope with the effects that the war had on him and the result is\\na passionate and sincere film. In the very opening scene we are introduced to Chris Taylor (Charlie\\nSheen) as he has just been deployed to Vietnam and is arriving at the\\nwar zone. He narrates the film through voice-over as he is writing\\nletters to his grandma informing her about the war. Unlike most of the\\nsoldiers, he wasn\\'t forced to go to the war, but volunteered after\\ngiving up on college. During the first few weeks he is struggling to\\nkeep up with the pace of war and no one seems to care too much for him\\nsince he\\'s the new kid who hasn\\'t yet been exposed to all the carnage\\nthey\\'ve experienced. Chris is currently serving two noncommissioned\\nofficers who couldn\\'t be more different from each other. On the one\\nhand there is scar faced Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) who seems to have\\nbeen in the war forever and on the other there is Sgt. Elias (Willem\\nDafoe) who is much more lighthearted and easy going. Both are experts\\nat war who know they are fighting with unexperienced soldiers. When a\\nvillage raid gets out of hand both Sergeants take opposite sides and\\nthe platoon is divided between those who support Elias and those who\\ntake Barnes\\'s side. Evidently the war has taken a toll on all these men\\nand some begin to question their very participation in it when they\\nrealize the enemy is inside each of them. There are also supporting\\nperformances from Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon, and John\\nC. McGinley who are all in the platoon together.There is no denying the emotional buildup during the scene of the\\nvillage raid and Johnny Depp\\'s face says it all during one of the\\nkillings that takes place there. It is one of the most intense scenes\\nI\\'ve seen in a war film. The performances in this movie are what stood\\nout for me. Charlie Sheen is great in the lead role, but it is the\\nconfrontation between Berenger and Dafoe that truly stands out. Both\\ndeserved their Oscar nominations despite not winning, but Platoon still\\ntook the top honors for Best Picture in 1987. My only complaint with\\nthe film perhaps was that it didn\\'t really need the voice-over\\nnarration from Charlie Sheen. Stone could\\'ve had enough faith in the\\naudience and let them see what he wanted to say with the images alone\\nand not spoon feed them with the narration. The excuse for its\\ninclusion is that he is writing his grandmother, but there are things\\nas the movie goes on that are evidently thrown in there so the audience\\ncould understand what he was thinking. It\\'s just a minor complaint\\nbecause his character was still the easiest to identify with. The score\\nand the cinematography are both effective and they enhance the horrors\\nportrayed in this film. Platoon still manages to have an impact almost\\nthirty years later and that is why it is a classic.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThis is my first review on IMDb - Hope you find it helpful Oliver Stone\\'s career speaks for itself to anyone interested in what\\nthis man has to say. His view of the U.S. politics and his realist\\ntouch is present in any of his films (and screenplays, look up\\nScarface-1983). So, when talking about this director, it\\'s either you\\nlove him or you\\'re not interested in his message. But he has voice, he\\nhas the raw energy and the impulse to make a change, be it social,\\npolitical or in the film industry. \"Platoon\" is a very personal movie. Simply put, it\\'s a must watch. The\\nreasons for me saying this are : I am very fond of war-movies placed in\\nthe 20th Century since all the major conflicts of the modern era\\ncreated the world as it is today, and you will find this one to change\\nyour perception about the Vietnam-War that you thought you knew; if you\\nwant to see Charlie Sheen\\'s best portrayal of his life you might want\\nto check out this movie; there are a lot of young actors (at the time)\\nin incredibly convincing roles; you have Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger\\nas opposite archetypes; you have intense fight scenes with an\\noutstanding cinematography; the movie is filled with likable characters\\nand even some funny moments and, to top it all - there is compassion,\\nrealism and a true sense of revelation through insight present in the\\nstory! The fact that the director himself was a soldier in Vietnam (his first\\nfilm - in 1971, is about his experience) provides a knowledgeable\\ngeometry of feelings about the subject - War in all its vast, vicious\\nand vulgar \"splendor\". The good guy Chris (Sheen\\'s character) is\\ntransformed by the horrors he witnesses, by the people he meets and\\nmost of all, by the decisions his fate seems to have taken for him - to\\nbe a part of this infernal conflict that seems to consume the spirits\\nof everyone involved. This is a movie best watched alone, for you to analyze it in detail and\\nto allow it to \"leave its mark\" upon your perception, because that is\\nwhat it does. I would compare it to \"The Deer Hunter\" or \"Full Metal\\nJacket\" in its nerve-shattering effect of how a man, noble in thought\\nand kind in action, is a participant in an abominable, absurd yet\\nabsolute conflict that will forever change his universe. For a mature viewer, with plenty of time to digest and discuss it,\\n\"Platoon\" is one of those rare films that show us the true extent of\\nour violence, vanity and visceral impulses. Man cannot conquer the\\nworld if he can\\'t even conquer himself. I give it a 9.8 out of 10. Enjoy!\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThis movie grips you right from the start to the end. As much clich\\xe9 as\\nit sounds, i didn't blink once throughout the movie as this movie will\\nbe a through entertainer and a sad remainder of the past. As both the\\ndirector and the writer for this masterpiece, he has successfully and\\naccurately depicted the horrors of the Vietnam War taken out straight\\nfrom his memory lanes when he volunteered to joined to fight for his\\ncountry. Charlie Sheen is amazing with his voice narration and genuine facial\\nexpressions. Williem Dafoe is surprisingly the good guy here and he is\\namazing too. But most importantly Tom Berenger gave the performance of\\na lifetime as an insane but ruthless leader and a true fighter. The\\nscore has served it's purpose of providing dark, serious atmosphere and\\ncombined with the voice narration of Sheen who has dialogs that hit\\nright in the feels , this movie is a must. It's not just the acting and\\nthe dialogs that are moving but the story itself is touching. With\\ncharacters struggling to cope up with this new found freedom, they inch\\ncloser and closer to insanity each passing day. The war has turned some\\ninto maniacs as it titillates their darker propensities of those,\\nexposing their inner demons which, in turn, gave birth to animistic\\nbehavior like raping children , killing innocents as a 'revenge' and\\nburning down villages . And they enjoyed doing it. Not a feeling of\\nguilt, not a single regret.The question that haunts me is after the war, those lunatics who\\nsurvived , what did they do with their lives? How did they adjust back\\nto the society? Well, what i think is that most of them ended up in the\\nstreets as those homeless , drunk , vets that are found so much in\\nabundance in the States.

       " u'\\nPlatoon was a deserving winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best\\nPicture, Best Director, Best Sound and Best Editing. It was a shame it\\ndidn\\'t net more Academy Awards. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem\\nDefoe are brilliant in their respective roles. Platoon was also notable\\nfor being the first film about the Vietnam War to be written and\\ndirected by a Vietnam veteran.Based on Oliver Stone\\'s experiences in the Vietnam War when he served\\nin the US Army, Platoon is told through the eyes of Chris Taylor played\\nby Charlie Sheen. Chris Taylor is an idealistic and naive college\\ndropout who enlisted in the US Army to serve in the Vietnam War. When\\nhe arrives in Vietnam, he is worn down by the exhausting and terrible\\nconditions and his enthusiasm to serve in the Vietnam War wanes. Chris\\nTaylor also narrates his thoughts and feelings via letters to his\\nGrandmother. Taylor also meets Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias, two\\nPlatoon Sergeants with contrasting personalities. Tom Berenger plays\\nthe battle scarred, world weary, callous and bad tempered Sergeant\\nBarnes, and Willem Defoe plays the compassionate, caring and free\\nspirited Sergeant Elias. The platoon is led by the fresh faced and\\ninexperienced Platoon Commander Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses) who\\nstruggles to assert his authority over the battle hardened platoon yet\\nit is shown that the men look up to Sergeant Barnes as their leader.\\nTaylor meets a variety of soldiers in his platoon including the\\ncowardly and sycophantic Sergeant O\\'Neill (John C. McGinley), Bunny\\n(Kevin Dillon), Junior (Reggie Johnson), King (Keith David), Rhah\\n(Francesco Quinn), Big Harold (Forrest Whitaker), Lerner (Johnny Depp),\\nCrawford (Chris Pedersen) and Francis (Corey Glover). The personalities\\nvary from compassionate, good-natured and affable, to angry, ruthless\\nand sadistic. Taylor finds himself conflicted when the horrors of the\\nwar take its toll and following a raid on the village which many\\nvillagers are beaten, killed, and raped, Taylor and the platoon find\\nthemselves taking sides with Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias.Charlie Sheen puts in an unforgettable performance in one of his early\\nmovies as Private Chris Taylor. You can\\'t help but feel that he is\\nchanneling his father Martin Sheen who previously starred in another\\nVietnam War movie Apocalypse Now (1979). Charlie Sheen has been\\nembroiled in numerous controversies recently including his (in)famous\\nfalling out with the producers of the TV series Two and a Half Men in\\n2011 and appearing in highly publicized interviews displaying his\\nbizarre behaviour and stating his catch phrase \"Winning!\".\\nControversies aside, many people forget that Charlie Sheen was\\nbrilliant in Platoon.Tom Berenger was previously known to play very likable characters but\\nhere he deserved an Academy Award nomination for his role as Sergeant\\nBarnes, a man who refuses to be killed in the Vietnam War. Willem Defoe\\nwho made his mark frequently playing villains was also very memorable\\nas the likable and compassionate Sergeant Elias.It was also great to see Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean),\\nForrest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), John C. McGinley (TV\\'s\\nScrubs) and Kevin Dillon (TV\\'s Entourage) in early roles.Oliver Stone who previously wrote Midnight Express (1978) and Scarface\\n(1983), made his mark as a director with Platoon which saw his career\\nskyrocket with hit movies such as Wall Street (1987), Born on the\\nFourth of July (1989), The Doors (1991) as well as controversial movies\\nJFK (1991) and Natural Born Killers (1994). Oliver Stone hasn\\'t had the\\nsame success in recent times with the mega flop Alexander (2004) and\\nmixed success with World Trade Center (2006), W. (2008), Wall Street:\\nMoney Never Sleeps (2010), and Savages (2012). Platoon is definitely\\nhis best movie to date as a director.Platoon\\'s theme song Samuel Barber\\'s Adagio for Strings has been\\npermanently imprinted into my memory. Although Adagio for Strings has\\nbeen heard frequently on film and television, it is a perfect theme for\\nPlatoon which sums up the bleak and depressing outlook of the Vietnam\\nWar.Platoon is an excellent though bleak movie that shows the horrors of\\nthe Vietnam War and soldiers as flawed human beings which will stay\\nwith you forever. Platoon definitely shows Tom Berenger, Willem Defoe\\nand Charlie Sheen at their finest and Oliver Stone\\'s best movie as a\\ndirector. Platoon earns its spot as one of the best war movies of all\\ntime right up there with Saving Private Ryan (1998), Black Hawk Down\\n(2001), Full Metal Jacket (1987), and Apocalypse Now (1979).9/10.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nPlatoon is loosely based on real life situations that writer/director,\\nOliver Stone went through when he was in the Vietnam War. This is also\\nparallel to Francis Ford Coppola\\'s 1979 masterpiece, Apocalypse Now.\\nI\\'m going to start out by saying that I found Apocalypse Now to be a\\nmuch better flick. Platoon is practically the same story with\\neverything inferior, which is why I\\'m not giving a perfect score. When\\ncompared, Platoon is inferior. Even when not compared, this movie gives\\na great sense of deja-vu. \"Haven\\'t I seen this before?\" Both movies are\\nabout a Sheen enlisting in the Vietnam War and transcend into madness\\nand insanity while partaking in the horrors of war. Apocalypse Now has\\nMartin Sheen on a mission to assassinate a demigod while Platoon has\\nCharlie Sheen\\'s mental state wearing thin after a massacre occurs.\\nApocalypse Now has build-ups and gets somewhere with the plot, and has\\nan overall better look. Platoon is certainly not bad. Heck, it IS as\\ngood as everybody says. It won Best Picture and Director of 1986, but I\\nthink Aliens should have won one of those. I think that any war movie is a great movie. Think about how it takes\\nthe action sequences to do and make-up to put on. Platoon\\'s action\\nsequences are excellent. But what makes Platoon the extravagant film\\nthat it is, is it\\'s accurate depictions of life in war. While movies\\nlike Rambo made war seem fun and cool, Platoon was back to reality. The\\nwhole idea of transcending into madness is shown so well by all and is\\nalways relevant.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is the most tangible movie I have ever laid my eyes on. I could\\nalmost smell the crap from the latrines and the sweat-soaked clothes on\\nthe soldiers.It also one of the most tense movies I have seen. It has a lot of quiet\\ntimes when people are just waiting or walking around and those moments\\nare no less tense than the action filled ones.The action....well it is not really what this movie is about and I have\\nseen better but it is still quite good. You will get your load of\\nexplosions.It is hard to talk about the story as there isn't really one. The movie\\nis generally about people's characters coming out over the course of\\ntheir time in the Vietnam war and the way those characters change,\\ninteract and clash.To make that non-story story work, there is whole star cast. Willem\\nDafoe and Tom Berenger are the two strongest roles. Some of the acting\\ncan be a little cheesy, but this was probably Tom's best role ever.The only problem I have is with the main protagonist, Charlie Sheen.\\nHis acting and his narration feel forced. I am not surprised that he\\nwould later start playing in comedy spoofs of action movies because\\nthat is how a lot of his acting felt like in this one. I expected him\\nto loose it and suddenly start laughing.Platoon is one of the best if not the best war movies of all time.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nI know many will probably disagree with me, but personally I consider\\nPlatoon to be the definitive Vietnam War movie, and I say that after\\ntaking into account Apocalypse Now. Although Apocalypse Now had a\\nnumber of moments of brilliance, but on the whole I think it suffers\\ndue to a disjointed script. Platoon on the other hand is intense right\\nfrom the get-go. Like many of the other films dealing with the Vietnam\\nwar,in this one too,the dark, gloomy and unrelenting jungles of Vietnam\\nserve as a separate character in itself. The soldiers find themselves\\ntrapped in the hell that we call war. Oliver Stone executes a detailed\\nanalysis of why soldiers tend to lose their sanity and their minds in\\nthe torturous conditions. There are a number of soldiers in the film\\nwho commit heinous acts and behave hideously, but considering the\\ncircumstances, it is understandable as in a hellish environment, it is\\nnot strange if people lose their humane qualities.For me Lt. Wolfe represents the leaders and the politicians who are\\nsupposed to lead and serve ordinary people, but they have no idea what\\nthey are doing and innocents lose their lives due to their incompetence\\nand lack of vision. Barnes and Elias represent the two schools of\\nthought in society that generally clash at the time of war and Chris is\\ncaught in the middle who is uncertain about whom to follow.The direction is brilliant, the cinematography is great, the scores are\\nhauntingly beautiful,the action scenes look as realistic as possible. I\\nthink the only negative aspect for the film is that Charlie Sheen is a\\nbit weak and unconvincing in some of the scenes.This film brilliantly gives you a bird's eye view of the terrible\\nexperiences that soldiers had to face during the war. I felt\\npsychologically drained just by watching this, I can't even begin to\\nimagine how it affected the real soldiers.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon is one of my favorite war films, right up there with Paths of\\nGlory. A young Charlie Sheen plays a new soldier who volunteered to\\nfight in Vietnam. This film traces his journey, along with his platoon,\\nover months of fighting.The action seems realistic, the cinematography seems realistic, the\\ncast are excellent, especially Tom Berenger (Barnes) and Wilem Dafoe\\n(Elias) who are battling each other while they battle for the hearts\\nand souls of the squad. Meanwhile, they need to get the squad\\nfunctional enough to battle the North Vietnamese Army NVA.Incredible action, highs and lows, while Sheen does a decent job of\\nportraying his moth-like change from a newbie to a hardened warrior.\\nThe music adds soulful feeling to the powerful fighting scenes and\\nrecovery. It's like they fight, recover, and are thrown back in again\\nfor more and more. The film wears you down, as you can imagine the men\\nbeing worn down at the same time. You will experience this movie like\\nfew other war films.Great film that the Academy rewarded with a well-deserved Best Picture\\nand Director. Enjoy.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nOliver Stone directed this powerfully told account of the Vietnam war\\nthat stars Charlie Sheen as recent recruit Chris Taylor, who arrives in\\nVietnam with enthusiasm, but quickly realizes that this war is not what\\nhe expected, as he is disrespected by the more seasoned soldiers for\\nhis inexperience, and shocked by the lack of purpose he finds in the\\nconflict, which is personified by his two non-commissioned officers,\\nBarnes(played by Tom Berenger) & Elias(played by Willem Dafoe) who hate\\neach other, and are polar opposites in philosophy and approach. Chris\\nwill eventually bond with his fellow soldiers, which will be painful\\nlater when so many are killed... Realistic and believable film with\\nfine performances and direction, though isn't always easy to watch. Won\\nthe Academy Awards for best picture and director.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nPainting a very grim but also realistic portrait of the horrors of war\\nand also illustrating how it affects the psyche & moral ethics of even\\nthe bravest, Platoon is a terrific blend of expert direction, compact\\nscreenplay & engaging performances that is counted amongst the finest\\nexamples of warfare filmmaking and deservingly so.Set during the Vietnam War, the story of Platoon follows a young\\nAmerican who drops out of college, enlists in the US army & volunteers\\nfor combat duty in Vietnam. Upon arrival, he finds himself caught in\\nbetween two non-commissioned officers who are constantly at odds with\\neach other, and has to battle with not just the enemy but also men\\nwithin his own platoon.Written & directed by Oliver Stone, Platoon presents the director\\nbrilliantly penning down his personal experience of Vietnam on the\\npaper before bringing it to life in the form of moving images. Stone's\\ndirection is truly commendable for he knows what he wants this film to\\nbe and what it needs to reflect about war & the deep scars it leaves on\\nanyone who ever was a part of it.Vietnam is brought to life in detail thanks to its clever set pieces &\\nwell-chosen shooting locations. Cinematography keeps a safe distance\\nfrom all the unfolding drama yet every captured moment has a story to\\ntell. Editing is nicely carried out for the most part & provides a good\\npace to the narrative. And as for the music, 'Adagio of Strings' by\\nSamuel Barber is a perfect companion piece to go with this war drama.Coming to the acting department, Platoon features a splendid cast in\\nCharlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe & Tom Berenger and all three of them shine\\nin their given roles. Sheen plays the naive kid who volunteers for war\\nin Vietnam where he undergoes a psychological meltdown of his own and\\nhis performance is compelling. Also adding more strength to the acting\\naspect are stellar inputs from both Berenger & Dafoe, with the latter\\nbeing the most impressive of them all.On an overall scale, Platoon is Oliver Stone's plea for humanity in the\\nface of something as harrowing & psychologically damaging as war and is\\na heartbreaking illustration of the loss of innocence, morals & ethics\\nthat also says much about the duality of man. It's technically\\naccomplished yet its real strength lies in the its script, direction &\\nadmirable performances from its cast. A memorable war drama that works\\neven better as a powerful meditation on morality, Platoon comes highly\\nrecommended.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nI am a big war movie fan and It think that this is one of the best war\\nmovies I've ever seen. It may not be as good as Apocalypse Now, but I\\nthink that this is defiantly one of the greatest war movies of all\\ntime.I first saw this and didn't notice that the main character was 21 year\\nold Charlie Sheen, star of the TV show Two and a half Men, but I did\\nrecognize William Defoe from the movie Spiderman and I didn't recognize\\nTom berenger. But I think that the acting in this movie is so\\npassionate and the reflection of their performances which is what makes\\nthis movie so realistic and tells the story of a awful war which should\\nhave never happened. The story is based on the actual experiences of Academy Award winning\\ndirector Oliver Stone. What an experience that man had. Like I can't\\nbelieve that the war was that bad and that in the jungle could make the\\nsoldiers lose their mind.It won four Academy Awards and well deserved for Best Sound, Best\\nEditing, best director and coveted Best Picture of 1986. The soundtrack\\nwas defiantly what made this movie so dramatic and emotional for some.\\nevery time I hear that soundtrack, my heart just sinks. The soundtrack\\njust hits me so fast and gets me caught up in the movie the moment the\\nmusic starts.In the Top 250 with a rating of 8.2/10 and is in my top 20 favorite\\nmovies of all time. I just love this film whether it's been caught up\\nin the dramatizations of how emotional this movie is or the fact that I\\nlove watching a movie with a lot of gun fighting.Great movie with passionate acting which expresses the very real\\ndramatizations of a very emotional war and deserved the four Academy\\nAwards it won.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nIf we talk about the war in Vietnam, we should talk about Platoon. It\\nis certainly one of the best films about Vietnam War and in my opinion,\\nit\\'s absolutely Oliver Stone\\'s best film since JFK and Nixon. Overall,\\napart from the credibility of the film director and also the\\nauthenticity in the depiction of the war, I find the screenplay,\\nediting and film direction stand out above all, not to forget the all\\nstar casts of two famous method actors, Tom Berenger (possibly his best\\nperformance ever) and Willem Dafoe. To be honest, deep within my heart,\\n\"Platoon\" ranked somewhere among \"Apocalypse Now\", \"Full Metal Jacket\"\\nand \"The Deer Hunter\" (the latter isn\\'t a war film) because of its raw\\nvisualization of the war horror that some consider a crime against\\nhumanity. I always get carried away by the spectacular music scoring,\\nsaddening, beautiful as well as frightening. The best music sequence\\nwould be \"Adagio For Strings\" by Samuel Barber and it\\'s your task to\\nfind out which sequence. Oliver Stone really did well in bringing us\\nthe rich psychological portraits of soldiers who fought the popular war\\nfrom a very interesting perspective, through the eyes of a rookie\\nsoldier (Charlie Sheen) who volunteered to defend his country, in a\\nfight against communism. We witness the harsh time they faced as soon\\nas they landed on the Saigon combat zone, in the jungle, with a simple\\nmission of staying alive from day to day. The line between good and\\nevil is the spot where Oliver Stone places the personal stories of the\\nmen whose horror and fear were their daily foods, real men who fought\\nand died in the Vietnam War. This unnecessary war was taped in brutal\\nrealism. Awesome combat scenes, frank, hard and strangely beautiful.\\nRobert Richardson as the cinematographer created a jaw-dropping\\natmosphere combining gray and bleak apocalyptic tones of the great wild\\nlandscapes. In conclusion, this is one of the greatest war films of\\ncinema history, it contains some moving scenes and offers a realistic\\nand cruel story of one of the greatest atrocities of humanity: wars.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nIt's over 25 years since I first saw Platoon. The highest praise I can\\ngive it is that I've seen only a handful of films since that come\\nremotely close to it's utter perfection.Without going into unnecessary detail, the movie is a claustrophobic,\\nmulti-layered Vietnam war film. Primarilly it's Oliver Stone's\\nsemi-autobiographical tribute to young men at war. It's an\\nunapologetic, unflinching look at the brutal chaos of fighting at the\\ncoal face, with all the associated moral turmoil and paralysing fear\\nbrought vividly to life. It's also a universal morality fable.It's plot is deceptively simple but essentially timeless, and that's\\none of the things I love about it: Platoon is perfect in it's scope and\\nexecution. It's depth is derived from it's characters (portrayed so\\nwell by a cast containing many young actors who's careers later\\nblossomed) and by it's authenticity.It doesn't pander to the audience, it doesn't attempt to explain all\\nthe intricacies of warfare in Vietnam (equipment, tactics, military\\nlanguage). It's often confusing, dark and disorientating. It requires /\\ndemands repeated viewings to appreciate the fuller picture.The principal characters are perfect in their conception: Chris as\\nnarrator and moral barometer, link to the viewer, who leads us through\\nthe various traumatic phases of survival from clueless raw recruit to\\nseasoned fighter. Barnes as deranged leader, Captain Ahab, the alpha\\nwarrior obsessed in his pursuit of the elusive (Moby Dick) NVA\\nregardless of cost to himself or others. And Elias, the counter balance\\nlove to Barnes's hate, the philosopher soldier who fights despite his\\nrealisation of the futility of the cause.The supporting cast, the aforementioned members of the Platoon, the\\ncrew of the Pequod, are also such an important part of the whole. They\\ngive perfectly balanced depth to the script and many of the pivotal\\nmoments revolve around them: they are not relegated to mere background\\nchaff.Ultimately, what remains after some 25 years is Stone's utter love and\\nrespect for the bravery and sacrifice of young men who fought and died\\nfor each other, regardless of political motive, and his anger at such\\nfutile waste.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nI hate quoting myself but as I said it before: \\'the best war movies are\\nabout wars that were lost for defeat is the most revealing of the\\nessence of war which already signs the defeat of reason, of\\ncivilization\\'. At one point, the central character of \"Platoon\", Chris\\nTaylor (Charlie Sheen) says: \"I see hell as the impossibility of\\nreason\", war is indeed hell because it jeopardizes all your beliefs and\\nall the values you stand for, and by the simple process of following\\norders in a blind patriotism, it leads men to their own principles\\'\\nbetrayal.And \"Platoon\" powerfully conveys the terrifying aspect of war as more\\nthan a series of battles opposing two military forces, but as a\\nconflict taking place in another arena of angst, pain and fear: the\\nminds of young soldiers, literally torn apart. War as an inner dilemma,\\nincarnated by two visions: one humanistic that can be perceived as pure\\nsuicidal crusading, another one, more realistic but that feels like a\\nnihilistic escape. And the power of the film is to incarnate this\\nduality through two characters, two actors who define two approaches to\\nwar: Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) the humanistic; Sgt. Barnes (Tom\\nBerenger) the realistic. Chris Taylor arrives in Vietnam with the\\ninnocence of a newborn baby and all his initiation will be driven by\\nthese two figures, as he says, he was \"raised by these two fathers\".\"Platoon\" shows the three different layers: the conventional Vietnam\\nWar, the \"civil war\" within the platoon where half the \\'grunts\\' follow\\nBarnes and the other half, including Taylor, follows Elias, and\\nultimately, the war as a state of mind. The result is a nightmarish\\nchaos where death can come from anywhere, it might as well be your\\nenemy, and your comrade and even yourself the battles are rarely\\nfrontal, rather circular where each spot can reveal a deadly presence.\\nSome soldiers can feel the presence of death, and this very pressure\\ncan either paralyze you when you see the enemy coming during an ambush\\nor it can make you shoot at any directions. It can also make a solder\\nsnap and provoke the massacre of whole villages. Barnes is pushed to\\nshoot a crying mother in the head, and reaches his breaking point at\\nthis very moment.The village massacre serves to show that in the name of so-called\\nAmerica\\'s ideals, the soldiers killed, massacred and committed deeds\\nthat were no nobler than the ones they were supposed to fight. Oliver\\nStone doesn\\'t condemn or glorify these actions, he only shows them with\\na gripping realism, showing is enough because it\\'s further than where\\nany other war movie went. It exorcises the inner demons of many Vietnam\\nveterans who couldn\\'t tell what they saw or what they did. It confronts\\nAmerica to its own actions; to the way the countries exploited poor\\nsoldiers for a war that wasn\\'t worth it. Maybe the film betrays a hope\\nin Oliver Stone\\'s mind, that the film would encourage the younger\\ngenerations to be able to use free will before fighting, and not to\\nthink that any war is worth to fight just because you owe it to your\\ncountry.And Chris Taylor doesn\\'t just incarnate the coming-of-age spirit of the\\nfilm; he represents the proud American patriotism altered by reality.\\nHe volunteered because, like his grandpa fought in WWI, his father in\\nWWII, he embodies the naive attitude that consists to think that any\\nwar is a fair war. That\\'s the kind of sensitive nerve patriotism tries\\nto touch, and that\\'s why so many young America went to Iraq to fight\\nbecause there were massive destruction weapons, and Saddam Hussein was\\nlinked to the September 11 attacks, shameful lies that ended up\\ndestroying a country. In the beginning, Taylor wants to discover these\\nanonymous guys at the end of the barrel, who define the real America,\\nsome who\\'ll make it, some who don\\'t, but it\\'s this camaraderie, this\\nmale bonding, this pride to serve the country that drives Taylor\\'s\\nheart. When he\\'s there, he understands the meaning of hell, he\\nunderstands why people are counting the days before relief, and more\\nthan anything he understands why they don\\'t understand his\\nvolunteering.Lack of understanding, impossibility to reason, it\\'s probably this\\ndisbelief that is forever immortalized by the shot of this dying\\nsoldier rising his arms through the air, trying to reach the\\nunreachable\\x85 In a country sparing of \\'mea culpa\\', Oliver Stone had the\\nguts to show the reality of the Vietnam War and its psychological\\naffect on young people who started being idealistic before discovering\\nhow low can humanity fall in the name of so noble ideals. His next film\\n\"Born on the Fourth of July\" tackled the political aspect but \"Platoon\"\\nis a 100% war movie and an extraordinary psychological thriller as well\\nsupported by a magnificent cast of supporting characters (Forest\\nWithaker, Terry Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp, Francesco Quinn, to\\nname a few) and spectacular special effects and sounds. Oliver Stone is\\nalso part of the praise not only for the directing but also for the\\nrealism he drained from his own experience in Vietnam.Indeed, just like I thought \"Schindler\\'s List\" was better directed than\\n\"The Pianist\" but \"The Pianist\" was a better told story because it was\\ndirected by a man who survived the holocaust, I would establish the\\nsame comparison with \"Apocalypse Now\", \"Platoon\" has a less epic scope,\\nbut it feels so personal that you know you couldn\\'t get any closer to\\nwhat the hell of the Vietnam war truly was, and that\\'s what makes it\\none of the most accurate, thought-provoking and emotionally affecting\\nwar movies movie ever made, or simply one of the best.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nOne of the best\\x85\\x85 Oliver Stone\\'s 1986 Vietnam era war film Platoon is\\none of the most authentic and probing films about the Vietnam War ever\\nmade. Not only does it show the dedication and courage of the soldiers\\nwho fought in the conflict is also shows the underbelly of the conflict\\nas well. The film, which is also written by Stone, stars Charlie Sheen,\\nForest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, and Tom Berenger and in one of his first\\nfilm roles Jonny Depp. The film tells the story of a newly arrived in\\ncountry volunteer private named Chris played very professionally by\\nCharlie Sheen. In the movie Chris goes from replacement \"new guy\" to\\nveteran soldier in the course of his tour and learns from those around\\nhim how to cope with his new surroundings. Along the way he learns how\\nto survive not only the enemy but also the environment and even those\\non his own side. He also learns to become a man from 2 polar opposites\\nand as he puts it 2 separate fathers. They are Staff Sergeant Barns\\nplayed by Tom Berenger and Staff Sergeant Elias played by Wilem Dafoe.\\nBoth of these characters play a big part in the development of Chris\\nand how he views the war and life in general. Staff Sergeant Barns is\\nmore of the no-nonsense hard charging win at any cost influence while\\nStaff Sergeant Elias is the more sage-like and introspective influence\\nwho takes a wider view of things. Throughout the film Chris evolves and\\nscared and somewhat excited volunteer to savvy and jaded veteran. The\\nfilms main theme is one of good vs. evil. This can be seen in many of\\nthe scenes and in the contrast between Dafoe and Berengers characters.\\nThe motif fits in well with the theme because Chris constantly has to\\nchoose between what he sees at right and wrong. This is especially true\\nin the scenes concerning the Vietnamese village. Music and soundtrack\\nare great in this movie. The songs, both original and not original fit\\nin perfectly with the time period and move seamlessly throughout the\\nfilm and set the mood perfectly. The battle scenes in this film were,\\nfor the time, some of the best ever shot until Saving Private Ryan came\\nalong and they set the standard for all that followed. This movie will\\ngo down as one of the classics of not only war films but of all films\\nin general regardless of genre. This is truly an American classic.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nBefore he was winning and before he was on his own drug, there was\\nPlatoon. Platoon stars Charlie Sheen and Willem DaFoe in the 80's. They\\nare soldiers in the Vietnam War. They experience the full blown hell\\nthat war produced. Platoon was directed by Oliver Stone and most of his\\nmovies are very long and have extreme detail. Platoon is no exception\\nhaving a deeper meaning than what is shown. Vietnam veterans suffered\\ngreatly during and after the war. Platoon shows the suffering during\\nthe war. I thought it was interesting how towards the end a soldier is\\ntalking the Sheen and he says if they survive the war they will go home\\nheroes and life will be easy. In reality it was the exact opposite and\\nI wonder if soldiers really thought that or if that was just for comic\\nrelief. Either way the story was basic, fight the war and survive, but\\nit turned into something more. It turned into what is right and wrong\\nin warfare and how or who to fight. Soldiers in Vietnam were exposed to\\ndrugs and Platoon shows how soldiers would relax by taking drugs and\\nsmoking cigarettes. The reactions to these drugs and the warfare itself\\ndrove soldiers insane and caused them to commit terrible acts that\\nPlatoon portrays. Platoon was historically accurate as well and that is\\nvery important. Situations the movie showed really happened. The scene\\nwhere they raid the village and terrorize the farmers actually\\nhappened. It was a historically known massacre that really happened; I\\njust can't remember the name. Soldiers didn't know who the real enemy\\nwas so they attacked everybody. Innocent people suffered because\\nAmerican soldiers could not control themselves and the pressures of the\\nwar got to them. They raped, murdered, and pillaged the village and\\nthat was just the beginning. They weren't only fighting the Vietnamese;\\nthey were also fighting each other. Barnes and Elias had their\\ndifferences and they fought constantly but the betrayal of Barnes where\\nhe basically murdered Elias was just epic. That scene was just so bone\\nchilling. Barnes chases him down and they stare each other down. It's a\\nshowdown and they look like they can read each other's minds. Barnes\\nshoots and Elias falls down to the ground. Barnes tells Chris, Sheen,\\nthat he is already dead. Chris and Elias were good friends and shared\\nsimilar opinions on the war. Barnes and Chris retreat to the helicopter\\nbut as they go up they see one of their own running towards the\\nhelicopter. It was Elias. He ate so many bullets and was bleeding\\neverywhere. It was the ultimate betrayal. He was killed by his own\\nsquad and he raised his arms and looked up to the sky which became a\\nclassic pose from the movie. He falls over, dies and the helicopter\\nflies away. Throughout the movie there is music from the Vietnam era\\nbut in every sad or serious scene the same tune of violins plays and\\nmakes the scene so much better. I always say the music can be the most\\nimportant part of a movie. It sets tone and mood. It can make or break\\na scene and every time those violins played the audience knows the\\nscene is important. Let me make one thing clear. I hate Charlie Sheen.\\nI don't think he is funny; he is crazy, and a terrible actor. He should\\nnot be allowed to make anything else in the industry but that is just\\nmy opinion. Luckily this was before all of that garbage and he really\\ndid a good job. In parts of his acting I laughed and thought it was\\nridiculous but about an hour into the movie he stepped it up and did an\\namazing job. It made me respect the man more for his acting and what he\\nhad in his young career. It is a shame he let drugs ruin his life. My\\nproblems with the movie were that there were a lot of characters,\\npossibly too many. Forrest Whitaker and Johnny Depp were in the movie\\nbut they disappeared. They were important for a scene and then I don't\\nknow what happened to them. Did they die? Did they leave the war? I\\ndon't know. Maybe somebody can let me know so please comment. For a war\\nmovie it wasn't the best I've seen but it wasn't really about the war\\nbetween the Vietnamese but more about the war with themselves and the\\nbetrayal of soldiers. It was more emotional than physical and in a\\nmovie about Vietnam that should be portrayed so kudos to Platoon for\\nthat. Overall it was a fantastic movie that was more than a war movie\\nbut an emotional tale of soldiers in the Vietnam War. They suffered\\ngreatly and this movie probably most accurately portrays the\\ndevastation of the war. Action, acting, emotion, music, and overall\\nperformance were all good. Platoon easily gets the WillyT seal of\\napproval but Charlie Sheen needs to just go away. I really just don't\\nlike the man or anything he is in, other than this movie. I could watch\\nthis movie again and again and can be viewed alone or with friends.\\nDon't let young kids watch it obviously; listen to the rating on the\\nmovie because it will probably not end well but still a great film for\\nmature audiences.\\n\",\n",

The frustration,\\nthe confusion, the helplessness and the rage that springs through it is\\ncaptured brilliantly by the director.The characters are intricately woven. Although I felt that the lead,\\nplayed by Charlie Sheen, was a tad weakly portrayed. Not to say that he\\nwas bad, but the character could have brought to life better.

       " u'\\n\"Platoon\" is timeless and describes the reality of the Vietnam war\\nbetter than any other. This film is not your typical cheesy Hollywood\\nmovie, and it is not surreal.Platoon makes everything seem very real. The film does try to be black\\nand white and is not afraid to show the complexities facing fighting\\nmen in Vietnam. However, the real greatness of this film is in the\\ngritty realism of the characters. Stone gathered a great and diverse\\ncollection of actors. Each character well developed and unique. In\\ndeed, the viewers are allowed to look at these characters and choose\\nwhich one best represents them and in that, perhaps sees how they might\\nhave done in Vietnam. Charlie Sheen\\'s character is innocence, heading\\nfor war. When he arrives in Vietnam, he must make the choice of what\\nkind of soldier he will be. Will he emulate Sargent Barnes, a hardcore\\nlifer that believes in killing them all and staying alive? Or will\\nSheen\\'s character choose to join the souls under Sargent Elias, a\\ncompassionate veteran, who realizes that American soldiers are still\\nhuman beings and should act as such. The greatness of this film, is\\nthat the choice is not cut and dry. Barnes represents the frustration\\nof many grunts in Vietnam. The frustration of seeing many friends die\\nand not knowing who your enemy is. The frustration of being placed in a\\nforeign land and not knowing how to win. Many young men see Barnes as\\ntheir savior, the man that will kill the enemy and keep them alive.\\nAlthough Barnes is evil, one can see why men would be attracted to him.\\nHowever, for many, Barnes is the worst of what war turns people into.\\nThese optimists cling to their humanity and to Elias, a Christ-like\\nfigure that attempts to keep the souls of those young soldiers pure.\\nThis film takes the viewer to Vietnam and puts them in the jungle. It\\nshows us why we would never ever want to be there.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nPlatoon in my opinion is tied with Apocalypse Now as being the best\\nVietnam War movie of all time, with Born on the Fourth of July right\\nbehind them. And Casualties of War being extraordinarily behind all 3\\nof those.This was Oliver Stone in the prime of his career when he was cranking\\nout this movie, Born on the Fourth of July, Wall Street, The Doors and\\nJFK. Actually Stone makes a very good choice in using The Doors as the\\nmusic for the movie.The movie has a fantastic cast with Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem\\nDafoe, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon and Keith David.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThis movie was downright unbelievable. Very well done and kept you\\ninterested throughout the entire movie. It shows the horribleness that\\nwent on in Vietnam and how it was truly a life changing experience. The\\nveterans over there went through very little sleep and had to go\\nthrough fear almost every parts of the day. I personally did not go in\\nthe Vietnam war but from what I heard this is the most realistic movie\\nof what happened in Vietnam. The ambush scene where Taylor is just\\nwaiting in fear with his hear pounding that the Vietnam soldiers would\\nnot see him. I also love the final battle scene it had lots of action\\nand was very intriguing. When Elias was running from the soldiers was a\\nvery emotional scene. Charlie Sheen was magnificent along with Forrest\\nWhittaker, Willam Defoe, Tom Berenger, and others. Taylor had to\\nwitness murder, rape, and injustice by his fellow soldiers or as he put\\nit \"he couldn\\'t tell what was right or wrong anymore. It was truly grew\\nand I highly recommend it.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThis is a very, very hard film for me to review. I was too young to be\\nin Vietnam (thank God) and I have no idea what the real Vietnam War was\\nlike. Was it like John Wayne\\'s THE GREEN BERETS? I am sure it was not!\\nBut, was it like PLATOON? I just don\\'t know. Did the soldiers in the\\nwar do drugs, kill civilians and run amok? Yes, but whether or not it\\nwas the norm (like it was shown in this film), I just can\\'t say. Some\\nVietnam vets I\\'ve spoken with say this film is accurate, others say it\\nover-emphasizes isolated incidents because it has an agenda. I just\\ndon\\'t know, especially since director Oliver Stone does have problems,\\nat least in some films, with fictionalizing events (such as in JFK and\\nAlexander). Regardless, it is a very powerful film.Unlike FULL METAL JACKET, this Vietnam War film begins in Vietnam. The\\nfilm opens with Barber\\'s \"Adagio for Strings\" providing an\\nappropriately somber and dirge-like musical introduction--newbie\\nCharlie Sheen arrives as body bags are being loaded into a plane. This\\nis the perfect music for the intro, though I must admit that later in\\nthe film it is overused just a bit--losing some of its impact.The film revolves around young Sheen and the men serving with\\nhim--soldiers on the front lines and in the middle of the action. Over\\ntime, the whole reason for them being their and their humanity all\\ncomes into question. This struggle is epitomized in the two sergeants.\\nOne, Tom Berenger, is a bit nuts. He\\'s willing to break the rules, kill\\ncivilians and become an animal. The other, Willem Defoe, is an equally\\nskilled soldier but cannot allow himself to give in to his darker side.\\nThis all comes to a head when Berenger and several others viciously\\nkill several villagers--villagers who could easily have been completely\\ninnocent and certainly did not deserve this. When Defoe swears to file\\na report about this, you know that eventually there will be a serious\\nconfrontation between these two men. However, it\\'s Sheen who eventually\\nfinds himself in the middle--and you are pretty sure that it will be\\nhim or Berenger that must die. Yet, there is STILL almost an hour left\\nin the film! The final hour is one of the most harrowing in film\\nhistory. It consists of one hellacious firefight after\\nanother--culminating in a battle along the Cambodian border that\\nultimately kills off most of the men in the platoon--and further\\ndehumanizes the survivors. For sheer violence and terror, I can\\'t think\\nof another war film that can even come close. It\\'s practically non-stop\\nand will keep you on the edge of your seat.So what did I think about the film? Well, watching it was certainly\\namong the most unpleasant experiences I have ever had! The extreme\\nviolence, the pointlessness, the horrible language and the drugs were\\nall pretty awful and didn\\'t make this a film for little kids, that\\'s\\nfor sure! But, you certainly must admire it for the intensity and\\nrealism you lack in many films--traditional war films that make war\\nseem fun or manly. You certainly can\\'t watch this film enjoy it--and\\nthat really is a good thing when you think about it.So, for a film that shows war in all its awfulness, you can\\'t find one\\nquite like PLATOON. Once again, I can\\'t attest to the voracity of the\\nportrait of the war, but for a vision of what war can be like, it can\\'t\\nfail to have a huge emotional impact. My only quibble, and it is minor,\\nis that Charlie Sheen seemed a tad young in his role--so much so that I\\nhad a hard time accepting him as a soldier among all these men.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nOliver Stone's hard-hitting, compulsively watchable Vietnam epic is\\nbased on his own experiences fighting in the US army. It's rightly\\nregarded as something of a classic film of the 1980s, and watching it\\nyou get the right idea about war: it's a terrible, soul-destroying, and\\nutterly nihilistic experience in which men are turned into cattle and\\nmoralities fly out of the window. It's also a hugely influential film;\\npretty much any Vietnam film made since must use this film as a\\ntemplate. You can't imagine Mel Gibson's WE WERE SOLDIERS without this,\\nfor instance.Unlike many modern war films, this isn't an action film, although there\\nis plenty of fighting. Instead it's an intense drama with some scenes\\nof physical violence and rape that are almost unwatchable \\x96 not because\\nthey're graphic, but because they're so powerfully portrayed and well\\ndirected. The film has something of a slow start, and it does take a\\nwhile for the lead, played by Charlie Sheen, to warm to the viewer (I\\nsuspect this is because Sheen has mercilessly spoofed his role in the\\nHOT SHOTS! films). Once we reach the jungle, though, the film hits a\\nhigh note, as loyalties are divided, booby traps and the enemy are\\nlurking around every corner, and tempers flare. Things culminate with\\nan overwhelming onslaught from the enemy in which everybody's fate is\\nfinally decided. The ending of this film is truly intense \\x96 I haven't\\nseen much like it \\x96 and will leave you feeling tired and emotionally\\ndrained afterwards.The cast is superb. It's one of those films where nobody puts a foot\\nwrong. By the end, Sheen is giving his greatest performance in a film \\x96\\never. Tom Berenger's scarred sergeant is a supremely scary creation,\\nmore monstrous than a dozen Kruegers or Vorhees. The film served as a\\nspringboard for many young actors in the '80s, so roles are fleshed out\\nby the likes of John C. McGinley, Forest Whitaker, Tony Todd, Johnny\\nDepp, Keith David, and Kevin Dillon. Cinematography, music, and effects\\nare all great but the one thing you'll take away with you is a\\ncareer-best Willem Dafoe as one of the good guys for a change.\\n\",\n",

The theme from \"Platoon\" is so epic & sad, it manages to capture\\nall the intensity and despair of the War.

At this point\\nOliver Stone had made his mark in Hollywood as an excellent\\nscreenwriter with classics like Conan The Barbarian, Scarface and The\\nYear Of The Dragon. This production was his breakout film as director.\\nHowever, if you ask me Salvador(which Oliver wrote and directed right\\nbefore Platoon) is a great film that never got the respect it deserves.\\nPlatoon is the first Vietnam War film to be made by a veteran and was\\nbased on Oliver Stone's experiences. Platoon is a very well structured\\nand great looking film that captures the gritty essence of war but is\\nbeautiful to look at as well. Characters are rich and well developed\\nand the story flows smoothly from scene to scene. Performances are top\\nnotch from an up and coming cast of great actors and future stars such\\nas Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, Keith David, Forest\\nWhitaker, John C Reily, etc. The story is told through Charlie\\nSheen's(Chris) perspective and is a morality tale about innocence lost,\\ndifferent takes on the war from soldiers who support the war and those\\nwho do the best they can to stay alive and survive a war they found to\\nbe immoral and insane. Willem Dafoe is from the latter camp as Sgt.\\nElias. Tom Berenger delivers his best performance as hard as nails hawk\\nSgt. Barnes. Following in the footsteps of his father(Martin Sheen) the\\nunderrated Charlie Sheen does an excellent job as the lead in his own\\nclassic Vietnam War film. The battle scenes are gritty and Oliver did\\nnot try to sugar coat the material in any way. He shows the madness and\\nbrutality of the war and did not shy away from showing atrocities that\\nbecame associated with the war. The film won a richly deserved Oscar\\nfor best film and director in 1986 as well as best sound and film\\nediting. Platoon made its mark and hold up great decades later as well\\nas making Oliver Stone a household name.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nTo be quite honest, the first time I saw Oliver Stone\\'s \"Platoon\" I was\\ndisappointed. Perhaps it was the fact that the presence of Charlie\\nSheen in the lead role invited comparison to \"Apocalypse Now\", starring\\nhis dad. However, even though both are war movies set in Viet Nam,\\ncomparing them is like comparing apples & oranges.Stone\\'s film is, first and foremost, a movie about the experiences of\\n\\'grunts\\' in this bloody conflict. In place of the surreal nature of\\n\"Apocalypse Now\", Stone and technical adviser Dale Dye brought a sense\\nof realism to the picture. That being said, while realism was enforced,\\nStone still managed to imbue his script with deeper meaning.The story revolves around young volunteer Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen)\\nas he arrives in Viet Nam and quickly becomes acquainted with the\\nhorrors of war. Apart from the enemy, there\\'s conflict among the\\nsoldiers themselves, as a rift develops between the compassionate Sgt.\\nElias (Willem Dafoe) and the ruthless Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger).Despite the fact that Charlie Sheen is in the lead role, the acting is\\nactually pretty strong. Berenger & Dafoe were both nominated for\\nAcademy Awards but they ended up losing to Michael Caine. The large\\nensemble cast includes several recognizable actors, often contributing\\nmemorable performances. Notable names include Keith David, Forest\\nWhitaker, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon and even a young Johnny Depp.Stone\\'s direction won him one of the film\\'s four Academy Awards.\\nAnother Oscar deservedly rewarded the sound department for their\\ncontribution to the film. Also notable was the extensive (and\\neffective) use of Samuel Barber\\'s \"Adagio for Strings\". Both visually\\nand sonically, the movie is impressive.Ultimately, \"Platoon\" isn\\'t quite perfect but it\\'s definitely good\\nenough that I\\'m glad I gave it a second chance. The movie\\'s realism is\\ncommendable and the storyline is thought-provoking. It may be no match\\nfor \"Apocalypse Now\" but that only means that it\\'s just a very good\\nmovie and not a masterpiece.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\"First real casualty of war is innocents; the first real movie on the\\nwar in Vietnam is Platoon\"That is a quote from the trailer that I felt encompassed what I felt\\nabout Platoon to a T. What makes Platoon so realistic is that it is\\npart of those rare occasions where you have a story born from a\\ndirector\\'s firsthand experience, but that\\'s what you get with Oliver\\nstone, who served as an infantry soldier in Vietnam, allowing him to\\ncreate an almost autobiographical account, and in some instances a\\ndocumentary into the under belly and less glamour side of war \\x96 and by\\nglamorous I mean not a place where you shot bad guys, then come home to\\na giant marching band and a handshake from the president, but instead\\nit\\'s actually a place where real and sometimes innocent people die.\\nWith so much realism it should be no surprise that Platoon won four\\nOscars in 86 in the best director, picture, sound and cinematography\\ncategories. Platoon tells the story of a student named Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen)\\nin the late 60\\'s who joins up for the army believing in his heart that\\nhe is fulfilling his patriotic duty, and I feel in some part that deep\\ndown he believes that he will go to Vietnam fire a few bullets and\\nreturn as a hero. But upon reaching, he joins up with a diverse platoon\\nof men, in the outside world would probably never rub shoulders with,\\nbut here they move as one, lead by two men; Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger)\\na man with a scared appearance, that adds to his mystical aura of being\\na man that cannot be killed and the other Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) who\\nthrough the use of mind altering drugs is able to maintain an air of\\ncalm. But Chris Taylor\\'s dreams of heroism are quickly obliterated as\\nthey delve deeper into enemy territory, witnessing acts of despicable\\nevil towards his fellow man by the very same men he serves within the\\nsame platoon, making him quickly realises how naive his ideas of war as\\nthey are not a rite of passage he once thought but instead war is\\nactually hell on earth where no side wins, captured perfectly in dark\\nand sinister cinematography. Reading of the credits was like a who\\'s who of Hollywood icons, it was\\nprobably one of the most successful bringing together of star names up\\nuntil then, with the likes of; tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe (Born on the\\nFourth of July), Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), Keith\\nDavid (The Thing), Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Kevin\\nDillon. You are guaranteed to find a name amongst them that is one of\\nyour favourite actors. But in a sea of big names and future big names,\\nI still felt Charlie Sheen (Hot Shots) was able to stand out and\\ndeliver a convincing portrayal of a conflicted man, caught up in the\\nultimate battle with himself as he has to choose between what\\'s right\\nand doing whatever it takes to survive, so basically choosing between\\nsafety of the body or safety of the mind. I also felt with such complex\\nemotions he had to show at a drop of a hat, and doing them so well that\\nit was a surprise and travesty that he wasn\\'t nominated for a single\\nbig award. I really do feel that a man\\'s innocents is truly lost in a war, and it\\nis a shamed you don\\'t get to see it played out on film, but that is\\nwhat also makes Platoon so special because unlike previous films based\\non the war in Vietnam such as; Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or\\nComing Home. Platoon is the very first not to look at the war from the\\nwide perspective, and not get caught up in the big budget special\\neffects. Instead it takes a profound and uncompromising leap into the\\nvery depths of the human condition; never shying away from exposing the\\nsinister side to us such is in the case of Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger)\\nand penetrating through the sense of false bravado to leaving a film\\noffering a sincere exploration of self.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\"Rejoice O young man in thy youth\" - Ecclesiastes. Written and directed\\nby Oliver Stone, \"Platoon\" is considered as one of the best war movies\\never made. Another masterpiece of the same director, also with Vietnam\\nwar topic is \"Born on the Fourth of July\" with Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic\\nreal life war veteran, based on true story. Oliver Stone took part in\\nVietnam war (he served there from September 1967. until November 1968.\\nbeing wounded twice and receiving couple of military decorations for\\nhis participation). After he returned home he decided to put his war\\nexperiences into a script of fictionalized war story which many years\\nlater was transformed into a movie inspired by war experiences that\\nStone had in Vietnam. That was how \"Platoon\" was made. A story with\\nauthentic background. Not popular with US.Army because it is telling of highly negative side\\nof the war (showing terrible war atrocities against civilians and\\nhorrors of fighting in the jungle) \"Platoon\" is a strong and emotional\\nstory about different characters of different people put together on\\ninevitable collision course with each other. Those hidden virtues and\\nfaults of those people have always been in themselves, they are only\\nemphasized in a war madness that surrounds them. Three main characters\\nSgt.Barnes (Tom Berenger) on one side, Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) on the\\nopposite one and private Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) between them come\\nfrom different life backgrounds and often have opposite and confronting\\nperceptions of the war and life itself. In every war, in every army, on\\nboth sides in every armed conflict there were always and there will\\nalways be people like three of them and people around them. Movie shows\\nplatoon divided between Elias and Barnes two centers of gravity and\\nthose who choose to be with one or the other.Sgt.Barnes is a battle hardened and ruthless warrior. A man who does\\nn\\'t care much for himself and others when it comes to having fire\\ncontact with the enemy. He lost his humanity and became like a blood\\nthirsty animal itching for fighting because it is the only meaning of\\nhis life left. What kind of life and pain formed his personality we can\\nonly guess, but outside of war he has no place, he has no purpose. And\\nhe knows that. Deep inside he hates himself for what he is and he does\\nn\\'t care if he is going to live or get killed. He openly challenges\\nothers to take on him (\"It\\'s just me and six of you guys, come on, no\\none\\'s gonna know\") but they don\\'t dare to do anything. Two statements\\ndefine his character and beliefs, first - \"Now, I got no fight with any\\nman who does what he\\'s told, but when he don\\'t, the machine breaks\\ndown. And when the machine breaks down, we break down. And I ain\\'t\\ngonna allow that in any of you. Not one\" and second - \"You smoke this\\nto escape from reality. Well, I don\\'t need to do that, I am reality \"\\nwhich is kind of his life statement.Sgt. Elias is opposite of him. Battle hardened and experienced fighter\\ntoo, but a man who can keep his balance, he will not cross the line,\\nthe point of no return that Sgt.Barnes crossed long time ago. Elias\\ndoes n\\'t have any illusions about the war, he had them on the beginning\\nbut they are lost meanwhile. As he says to Chris Taylor \"We are going\\nto lose this one\" he considers it a wrong war to fight as he realized\\nafter disappointments that he had about its cause. If he lost his\\nillusions he did not lose his humanity. A man who will do the right\\nthing when it matters most and lose his life because of it. Chris Taylor is rebellious and idealistic person who escapes from life\\nat home full of restrictions and rules trying to gain an experience of\\nhis own and what he finds is not quite as what he expected, if he had\\nany idealistic illusions they are soon crushed by harsh realities of\\nwar and the way it transforms people pushing the best and worst in them\\nto the limits of human tolerance. In the end he is left deeply\\ntraumatized with psychological scars that will take many years to heal\\nand become bearable. Story about different characters of different people rejected by\\nsociety but in war they have just what they need with some of them\\nseeing it as a way to project worst parts of their personality and stay\\nunpunished. As many other great movies, \"Platoon\" is a story about\\nhuman character, about the best and worst in all of us. Part of us that\\nmakes us be the greatest humanists and part of us that makes us be the\\nworst criminals. Chris Taylor puts it great when he says that he is \"a\\nchild of two fathers - Elias and Barnes\" because he has what both of\\nthem have. Humanity of Elias and killing instinct of Barnes because in\\nthe end he kills Barnes. Others are mere reflections like Sgt.O\\'Neill,\\nan ordinary coward, psychopath Bunny, a dog of war released from his\\nchains, or Rhah, King and Big Harold who can still find strength to\\njoke after all. Joke is their best cure. For Chris and others there are\\nmany years left to heal from scars deep inside their souls as he says\\nit in words that can be the point of the whole movie - \"I think now\\nlooking back we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves and the\\nenemy was in us... But be that as it may, those of us who did make it\\nhave an obligation to build again, to teach others what we know and to\\ntry with what\\'s left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to\\nthis life\".\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nNot really big on Oliver Stone, but his depiction of the Vietnam war is\\nbrilliant in this heavy, dark tribute to the men who died in the war.Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Willam Dafoe all make one big triangle\\nin this film, as it revolves around the conflict going on between them,\\nand by them, I mean Willem Dafoe's squad, and Tom Berenger's squad in\\nthe Platoon, while Charlie Sheen is caught in the middle to deal with\\nboth, struggling to maintain his sanity as the depression of the war\\ngets to him every day.All performances are excellent. Even though the beginning consists of\\nSheen being an innocent little girly man, the war progresses, and he\\nbecomes a brutal life risking grunt that ruthlessly kills everything in\\nhis path, showing how the war affects him mentally.The sound of the film sounds muddled every time somebody opens their\\nmouth, not sure what Stone's intentions were, but it won the Oscar for\\nsound, so whatever. The film isn't centered around combat, or the\\nrealism of war, it's centered around the duality of men, and how the\\nwar affects the minds of the soldiers, and the different types of\\nsoldiers that faced the war.The beginning scenes consist of the Platoon getting to know each other,\\nleading up to one of the most infamous and controversial scenes in\\ncinema history, the village. It's interesting to see different\\ncharacters of different personalities conflict each other over being\\nwith a different squad leader, like are you guys in high school? Either\\nway they find a way to make it more intense.Not too heavy on atmosphere, history, or in depth messaging like\\nApocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter, but it gets it around pretty easy,\\nand the message about the war bringing out the best or the worst in men\\nis carried out pretty easy also. Very excellent war film, isn't along\\nthe lines of Saving Private Ryan, (my favorite war film) but definitely\\ngive it a viewing.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nFirst and foremost I must say that Platoon is my favourite movie of all\\ntime.I have to admit that when I first watched it way back in '88, it\\nwas not as thrilling, as I expected something of the likes of MIA or\\nRambo. At the time I was 12 years of age and I remember the Vietnam\\nfever was at its peak, in terms of movies eg MIA, Rambo ,POW the Escape\\nto name few.However, as I watched it for the second ,third and countless other\\ntimes thereafter, I realised that the movie was and still is a\\nmasterpiece. The graphic nature of the war was exceptionally depicted\\nand the acting by the characters of Sgt Barnes, Sgt Elias and Taylor\\nand others was brilliant! Sgt Barnes(Tom Berenger), I truly believe\\nshould have been nominated and should have scooped the Best actor at\\nthe Academy Awards of 1987 (he was robbed)Sgt Elias should have scooped\\nthe best supporting actor award( he was robbed too)The two actors\\nshould not have been put together in the same category.I think that is the way the war in vietman really was (We're gonna lose\\nthis war, we've been kicking other peoples asses for so long, I figure\\nits time we got ours kicked)That was the brutal truth. No macho\\nheroism, just reality.On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Platoon 10 out of 10\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nThe movie is fascinating in showing the real battle scenes, and\\ndescribing the conflicts faced with a lot of GIs for the moral of the\\nwar.Yet, I have a question here. The movie seems to be centered with two\\nSergeants, Barnes and Elias, the former was a killing machine while the\\nlatter tried to keep himself abreast of the chaos of war and stick to\\nhis own conscience and moral values. Elias didn't like Barnes, but he\\nstill regarded him as a reliable fellow grunt in battles. However,\\nafter the conflict in the small village, Barnes vowed to kill Elias and\\nexactly did so on purpose when chance permitted.My question is, is this teammate-killing a common sight in Vietnam? It\\nis said the movie was partly based on the personal experience of Oliver\\nStone. But I am not sure whether this center-piece of the movie was\\nbased on real happenings or not.It is interesting to note that there is also a similar parallel in the\\nnovel which FMJ is based on. In the novel (The Short-Timers by Gustav\\nHasvord), Animal Mother fragged down his own platoon leader\\nintentionally.Still, I doubt this was a common thing in the soldiers who served in\\nVietnam. It is just inconceivable for me that soldiers would kill each\\nother for some disagreements, even it is about moral values.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nGoing into this film, I had no idea what I was in for. I expected a\\nmere, gritty war tale, and Platoon is not that. It's a powerhouse of a\\nfilm that is disturbing, intense, and at times, grotesque.The film follows a Platoon of soldiers during the Vietnam war, and the\\nmain protagonist is the naive Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). The the\\nplot progresses the platoon through Chris' arrival, the power battle\\nbetween Sgt. Barnes and Sgt. Elias (Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe\\nrespectively), and to a series of events that illustrate the horrors of\\nwar.The technical aspects of the film help in this illustration The\\nediting, cinematography, and sound all come together to form a\\ntechnical tour de force. This is one of the most technically\\naccomplished war films I've seen to date.The power battle between the two sergeants is the most interesting part\\nof the film, as one officer represents the way war is perceived by\\noutsiders: valiant and noble; while the other represents the true\\nnature of war: grotesque and brutal. The film's standout performance\\ncomes from one of these soldiers, and that belongs to Tom Berenger as\\nSgt. Barnes. He's a ruthless and brutal man, and plays well opposite\\nWillem Dafoe,mwho is also quite good.On the other hand, Charlie Sheen's performance was one of the film's\\nfaults. His Voice-over is monotone and boring, as is most of his\\nperformance. There are a few moments where he shows some chops, but\\nthey were too few, and too far between.My only other issue with the film isn't a problem per sey, and the film\\nactually benefits from it. But with this film being so graphic, it's\\nhard to see myself watching it a second time.Overall, Platoon is a great war film that is, unfortunately, Held back\\nby its lead performance while still managing to show us the dark side\\nof the battlefield.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nMy beef, with this movie is that though it\\'s set in the Vietnam War in\\n\\'67-68; it doesn\\'t quite jive as an drama with action picture. It seems\\nas though Stone felt obligated to have firefights since NOT having any\\nwould be detrimental for audiences and undermine the chaos of war by\\nportraying it as \"uneventful\". Or, he didn\\'t want to \"glorify\" any war.\\nThe battles seem too meandering. No real outcome is implied or alluded\\nto. Furthermore, Sheen\\'s acting while not underacting, certainly is\\noverdone. Specifically when he snaps in the ville at suspected VC.\\nAlligator tears and wrought brows were probably not character\\nrequisites, but Stone\\'s \"method directing\". If you watch the special\\nfeatures, you\\'ll learn of Stone\\'s madness to \"inspire\" great acting.\\nThe final thing that bothered me, was how Elias and Taylor rationalize.\\n\"We\\'re gonna lose this war. We\\'ve been kicking other peoples\\' asses for\\nso long, it\\'s time we got ours kicked.\" So that\\'s what America failed\\nto see in that quagmire ? \"The truth\\'s in the eyes! When you know, you\\nknow!\" So a gut instinct is substantial enough to warrant a summary\\nexecution ? This is ethically flawed judgment at it\\'s worst and\\napparently, Stone\\'s best. Or, a reflection of Stone\\'s own rationale ?\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nPlatoon does a nice job of balancing reality with Hollywood theater.\\nThe atmosphere is pretty much spot on, with only a few scenes going a\\nbit over the top. The \"war\" in Vietnam was supposed to be a somewhat\\nnormal \"by the book\" conflict, but everyone on the ground found out\\nfast that the rule book just wasn\\'t translated into Vietnamese. The\\ncharacters portray the general feelings that persisted through much of\\nthe war, including the in fighting and back stabbing in some units. It\\nwas a brutal, non-standard conflict, and it reflects that reality all\\nthe way through the movie...But...the movie also crosses the line by implying that the conduct of\\nthe soldiers in Platoon is somehow justified. As the years after\\nVietnam have come and gone, we are seeing more and more incidents where\\nAmerican soldiers are not holding to the conduct that built this\\nnation. Iran. Afghanistan and Pakistan are merely the latest examples\\nof how our own moral values have been left by the wayside.Anyway, overall this movie is gratingly accurate in showing the\\nrealities of \"modern warfare\" on the ground. I liked it, but it also\\nmade me cringe at the same time. Perhaps that is the real intent of the\\nmovie, and it does make you rethink your own values...\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nPLATOON / (1986) **** (out of four)\"Platoon\" was one of the first movies to portray its subject in a way that\\ndoes not glamorize war. Many war movies, such as the recent \"Pearl Harbor\"\\nand \"The Patriot,\" create an involving sense of adventure and strategy,\\nthus\\nshinning an entertaining light on combat. \"Platoon\" set the standards for\\nwar movies to follow. It is an unmistakable, startling depiction of\\nVietnam.\\nNo other war movie more graphically presents its material as believable\\nand\\ndisturbing; not \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"The Deer Hunter,\" \"The Killing Fields,\"\\nor \"Saving Private Ryan.\" This is the kind of movie young people should\\nwatch before they enlist in the army. It will make them think twice about\\ntheir decision.The film\\'s main character is said to be based on director Oliver Stone\\'s\\npersonal experiences while fighting in Vietnam. His name is Chris (Charlie\\nSheen) a college student who enlists in the military because he believes\\nit\\nto be his patriotic duty. The movie introduces the character\\'s environment\\nuncomfortably well. We sense many soldiers lack rest and fulfillment; many\\nare at the point of physical breakdown. There are long shots of exhausted\\nsoldiers wandering through the woods, potential danger lurking behind\\nevery\\ntree. A snake slithers around a soldier\\'s leg. Dozens of red ants crawl\\ndown\\na resting man\\'s neck. We can almost feel the enormous weight of their\\nbackpacks on our shoulders. The portrait Stone paints is unimaginably\\nvivid;\\nwe squirm in our seats.The soldiers often sit around, discuss things of no importance, use drugs,\\ndance, and act like general fools. The film portrays the soldiers as many\\nmight believe actual soldiers behave. \"Platoon,\" gives each character a\\npersonal dimension. The actors inject a taut edge into the characters.\\nCharlie Sheen creates the illusion that Chris listens and thinks about the\\nwords and actions of others. He is an inquisitive, just character,\\ndisplayed\\nwith a sense of unease and frustration. Willem Dafoe, arguably at the\\ncenter\\nof the film, delivers a strong performance as a skilled fighter, but a man\\nwho tries to escape the horrific realties through drugs. The most\\nthought-provoking, powerful performance comes from Tom Berenger, as a\\nsadistic, determined veteran sergeant with a face deformed by a vast\\nhistory\\nof bullet wounds. Even the supporting cast, including Forest Whitaker,\\nJohn\\nC. McGinley, Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp, and Tony Todd,\\nconvincingly display a sense of fear and disorientation.\"Platoon\" makes clear that war is hell. Oliver Stone writes no actual\\nplot,\\nbut instead a collection of scenes that do not contain adventure,\\nstrategy,\\nor orientation. We realize any character could die at any given time. The\\nenemy is not given personality, or even a point of view. We see them as\\nthe\\nsoldiers see them, as distant figures in the jungle paths. They provoke a\\nclear impression of danger lurking from all around. There is little\\nevidence\\nof choreography or style. The battle scenes has no order. Most of us will\\nnever know what war is like, thank God for that. But movies like this can\\ngive us an appreciation of combat, and of Vietnam.I would like to close this review with the final lines of the movie. I\\nfeel\\nthese accurately conclude the statement \"Platoon\" makes about Vietnam.\"I think now, looking back, we did not fight the enemy, we fought\\nourselves.\\nThe enemy was in us. The war is over for me now, but it will always be\\nthere, the rest of my days. As I\\'m sure Elias will be, fighting with\\nBarnes\\nfor what Rhah called \"possesion of my soul.\" There are times since, I\\'ve\\nfelt like a child, born of those two fathers. But be that as it may, those\\nof us who did make it have an obligation to build again. To teach to\\nothers\\nwhat we know, and to try with what\\'s left of our lives to find a goodness\\nand a meaning to this life.\"Charlie\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and not just war movies. I\\nmean all movies. Oliver Stone did an excellent job of depicting the struggle\\nto get along between men in a chaotic setting.Tom Berenger does an excellent job playing the hardcore Sergeant Barnes who\\nsees the only way to win the war is to blow away anyone and everyone\\ninnocent or not. His superb acting makes the viewer dispise him, and cheer\\nat his ironic but obvious demise.Willem Defoe does a great job acting and should be in a lot more movies\\nperiod. He has an awesome talent that is never seen because he stars in\\nmovies that aren't totally mainstream. He plays the opposing role to\\nBerenger. Sergeant Elias, a man that sees himself in the hell of vietnam but\\nkeeps his humanity instead of turning into a savage with no morals like\\nBerenger.Let's not forget Charlie Sheen who does an outstanding job. Especially when\\ncompared to his other movies Hot Shots, Hot Shots Part Duex, Major League,\\nMajor League 2. Although funny and good for a laugh are not worth his time\\nwhen he could act in a movie that has a meaning.This movie is great and only bettered when you watch it on DVD. I Also would\\nthank Oliver Stone for a movie that is quality and deserves to put into any\\nmovie collection.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\n Platoon is a realistic look at a young GI's experience in the Vietnam War.\\nCharlie Sheen plays the young soldier who is fresh off the helicopter and\\nforced to see a world of horror. He goes with his platoon into the jungles\\nand villages and comes to terms with killing iin the name of his country.\\nTom Berenger and Willen Dafoe masterfully portray his supervising officers\\nwho have opposing views. The cast is terrific. This is Oliver Stone's\\nseminal early crowning acheivement.****\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nSimilar in many ways to another quality war film, Casualties of War, Platoon\\nis a story that takes place during the Vietnam War and is about a platoon\\ntorn basically between good and evil. Oliver Stone relies heavily on\\npersonal experience in the war in his writing of the film, in which the\\nabove-mentioned platoon is divided by the brutal activities that take place\\nin the overtaking of a village in Vietnam. Charlie Sheen plays the role that parallels the role played by Michael J.\\nFox in Casualties of War. He is the narrator who tells the story of his\\ndisillusion with the camaraderie that develops between men during service in\\nthe war, which he left a fairly cushy lifestyle to volunteer for.I've never served in the military, much less been in battle, but it is clear\\nthat nothing is sugar-coated in this film, which leads me to willingly\\nbelieve that what you see on the screen is exactly what it was like in\\nVietnam, especially given the fact that Oliver Stone served in that war\\nhimself. The war drama is made even more realistic by the fact that so many\\nof the actors were, at the time at least, relatively unknown, which is one\\nof the things that has always bothered me about Saving Private Ryan. In\\nPlatoon, these are just regular guys from everywhere and anywhere and\\nnowhere, and they are all stuck in the same situation risking (and in many\\ncases losing) their lives in battle. The Vietnamese were portrayed as savages to some extent, but that's because\\nthey are obviously the antagonists from the point of view that the story is\\ntold, which is Private Chris Taylor's (Charlie Sheen) point of view. On the\\nother hand, this portrayal can be forgiven because their tactics in many of\\nthe battle scenes are fairly clear, it's obvious how intelligently they\\nfought the war.I think that one of the things that makes Platoon so good is some of the\\nmany memorable scenes in the film, particularly those involving Sergeant\\nElias, played brilliantly by William Dafoe. The view from the helicopter of\\nhim being chased (unarmed and suffering from gunshot wounds inflicted by\\nsomeone on his own side) by dozens of rifle wielding Vietnamese soldiers is\\nan absolutely terrible thing to witness, and is one of the many ways that\\nthe sheer brutality of this war is presented in this film.Of the countless war films that are made, every once in a while a truly\\ngreat one comes along, and Platoon is one of the great ones. It doesn't try\\nto sugar coat anything, but presents the viciousness and violence of the\\nVietnam War as straightforwardly as possible, which is one of the many\\nthings that makes it so good. It is not only a startlingly realistic piece\\nof entertainment, but also a good place to learn a little bit about the\\nkinds of things that went on in the Vietnam War, and what go on in any war.\\nThis is great cinema.  \\n\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nI've never been in war but I can imagine it's one of the worst experiences a\\nhuman could go through. Finally, Oliver Stone applied this principal to his\\nwar epic Platoon. The film is staggeringly truthful on what war does to\\npeople, and although it doesn't show the after effects of war like such\\nfilms as The Deer Hunter or Oliver Stone's other war epic Born on the Fourth\\nof July, it shows why war does this to people. Who would want to be in the\\nsituation that Charlie Sheen's character was in? War is scary and Oliver\\nStone does a great job showing this fact in this truly great war epic.\\nRichardson's cinematography helps add to the drama as do the all around\\ngreat performances. I felt Charlie Sheen deserved an Oscar nomination for\\nhis amazing performance.A fantastic war epic that is a very scary but truthful and necessary film\\nexperience.Won four Oscars including Best Picture (1986) and Best\\nDirector.****1/2 /5\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThe photography in this film is great - it's got lots of original camera\\nmovements and shots.  For example when Taylor shoots Barnes in the end, the\\nshot stays on Bob as the bullets hit him.\\nThe downside I found, was that it seemed predictable once some basic\\ncharacter traits had been developed.  We could all see Taylor surviving to\\nthe end, and that many of his mates would perish.  Also that Elias would be\\nshot by Barnes seemed too obvious.\\nI think a few moments of Taylor narrating to the audience a quick reminder\\nof what the US was doing in Veitnam and why there was fighting would have\\nbeen helpful.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThis movie did a great job showing the psychological turmoils that a new\\nsoldier faces.  It shows that a person can become lost and hopeless during\\na\\nwar.  The rivalry between Sergeant Barnes and Elias is also very\\nrealistic.\\nThis movie really gets people to think about the dedication of the\\nsoldiers\\nin the Vietnam war- their courage and bravery.  It was a very powerful\\nmovie\\nand everyone should take some time to watch it!  \\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nOliver Stone`s masterpiece. Ranks with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal\\nJacket.\\nThis movie shows the human side of the Vietnam war, focusing on the\\nexperiences of a raw recruit played by Charlie Sheen. Two feuding\\nofficers,\\nElias (Willelm Dafoe) and Barnes (Tom Berenger) characterise two kinds of\\nsoldier - Dafoes the more caring - and Taylor (Sheen) must choose which\\npath\\nto follow. Elias`s ethos finally wins and Taylor finally becomes the\\nmonster\\nhe tries to avoid while avenging him. Unflinching in showing the brutality\\nof the conflict Platoon far from glorifies this war. The final battle\\nscene\\nis amazing, but this film is far from just an action film. In my view\\nDafoe\\nis the star. Highly recommended.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis film should be the standard for all war pictures. Believe me when I say\\nthat it is in fact better than The Bridge on the River Kwai. Stone includes\\nso many deep, emotional messages throughout the film. Why can't film\\ndirectors include as much drama in a war picture as this one has? War is\\nhell. It's been called hell for ages, Stone finally applied that to this\\nmasterpiece of a war film. One of the most frightening, terrifying, most\\ndramatic pictures I have ever witnessed. Many emotional and thought\\nprovoking scenes are what makes this film so much better than any other war\\npicture. The actors ACT like they are in combat, a rare sight to see in war\\nfilms. Richardson's cinematography helps add to the drama as does Barber's\\nAdagio for Strings.

       " u\"\\n\\n`Somebody once wrote: \\x91Hell is the impossibility of reason.'  That's what\\nthis place feels like: Hell.'So Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) writes home after experiencing combat in\\nVietnam.  What makes Oliver Stone's account of the Vietnam War so\\nremarkable\\nis the depiction of that complete lack of reason.  This is not a war where\\nthe lines of battle are\\ndistinctly drawn.  The fighting overlaps itself.  We see soldiers\\nsurrounded\\non all sides while sleeping.  We see American bombers attacking their own\\ntroops after a miscalculation in coordinates.  We see a Vietcong soldier\\nstrapped with explosives run into a tent filled with officers.  We see the\\nwar for how it must have been: total chaos.\\nConfusion permeates scenes of brutality.  No one in the film knows what is\\ngoing on.  Why are they fighting?  How do they end up here?  Will they die\\nin the next battle?These questions are at the heart of Platoon.  There is no real plot to the\\nfilm and to try to describe one is demeaning to the film's content.  I will\\nonly say a major theme of the film is conflict.  However, it is not only\\nthe\\nconflict between two armies fighting for two distinct causes, but also the\\nconflict among the soldiers on how to fight.  The `why' of fighting never\\ncomes into play, because there is no reason to ask `why' they are fighting.\\nThe soldiers are as confused as the civilians are.  At one point, the\\nplatoon is surprised to\\nlearn they have crossed into Cambodia.The lines of combat are drawn within the American troops as well.  There is\\na conflict of conscience.  The sides are very distinct, and the leaders are\\nas different as two men can be.  The first, Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger), is\\na\\nscarred, war-torn man, who, at one point, kills an innocent woman to force\\nher husband to talk.  The second, Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe), is a kind,\\nconcerned man who stops Barnes from massacring the entire\\nvillage.  As the film progresses and we see the chaos continue, we know\\nthat\\nthese two men represent, in completely general terms, good and evil.  By\\nthe\\nend of the film, Chris will have learned from both these men, and we see\\nhis\\neducation progress throughout the story.  One minute he shoots at the feet\\nof a crippled civilian to make him dance and the next stops a gang\\nrape.There is social conflict, also, among the troops.  Chris is an enlisted\\nsoldier, one of the few among a platoon of drafted men.  They express their\\ndisgust with a system that filters out the poor and uneducated to fight and\\ndie in place of the privileged.  Race is another qualification in the\\ndraft,\\nand the African-American soldiers state hatred for the system also.  No one\\nin the film wants to be in Vietnam.  Even Chris who signed up knows he has\\nmade a terrible mistake the instant he steps off the helicopter.Stone argues that evil won the war.  The complete confusion lead to chaos,\\nand in this chaos, the war was fought and lost.  This loss was not\\nmilitary,\\npolitical, or social, but moral.At the end of the film, Chris says that those who made it out of Vietnam\\nhave an obligation `to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness\\nand a meaning to this life.'  After what we have seen occur in the film, it\\nis almost impossible to believe that any of them will find these things.\\nIt\\nis this fact that makes the film utterly heartbreaking.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is the greatest war film of our time. Oliver Stone's Vietnam War\\npicture is just simply amazing in every aspect.

What makes this film so great is the realism brought out\\nwithin\\nthe movie. Oliver Stone (writer and director), really does a great job of\\nshowing the effects the war had on the soldiers. Stone having been in\\nVietnam himself, shows a soldiers\\' point-of-view of the war being not only\\na\\nshattering physical obstacle, but also a mental one. \"Platoon\" is a drama\\nthat gives you an experience of the horror that was Vietnam. The brutality\\nof the scenes and the intensity of the characters help maintain an idea of\\nthe paranoia and fear the war caused. This movie is never disappointing\\nand\\nalways keeps you interested. The excellent writing and superb acting makes\\nthis film hard to forget.

If we ever go to war with aliens,\\nsending them a copy of this will soon get rid of the little gits.

       " u'\\n\\nPlatoon is easily one of the best war movies ever made. Oliver Stone, one of\\nthe great directors of our time, will probably be known most for this film,\\na portrait of war  where the soldiers are true everyday guys, the superiors\\nare lifetime warmongers whose sole purpose on earth was to fight, and an\\nenemy who is as much a part of the hot, humid jungle as the leaves and trees\\nand life.  This was a film where Charlie Sheen was at his best, an actor who appeared\\nto have a bright future ahead of him (and did as great a job in Stone\\'s\\nWallstreet), only to see him end up doing straight to video fare and TV\\nsitcoms later.  Other actors were offered this part and others asked for it\\n(Tom Cruise) but it was like it was made for Sheen. And for any fan of film,\\nit\\'s hard not to have flashbacks to Apocolypse Now hearing Sheen\\'s voice\\nover sounding so much like his dad\\'s in the latter film.The cast is great, filled with other actors who have went onto more fame and\\nfortune (Forrest Whitaker, Johnny Depp) and Tom Berrenger is the best of the\\nbunch, playing the scarred, scruffy voiced sargeant that spawned so many\\n\"were there really soldiers who really took out their superiors in that\\nwar?\" discussions.I love Oliver Stone and he has done some great work, but this is still his\\ncrowning achievement and I doubt he could ever top this film.  He makes the\\naudience member another soldier in the platoon.

       " u\"\\n\\nThere have been several excellent war films about the Vietnam war, but\\nthis\\none is by far the most powerful.  Full Metal Jacket dealt with the\\npressures\\nthe young troops had cope with before being shipped out to war, and\\nApocalypse Now centered its attention on Marlon Brando's and Martin\\nSheen's\\ncharacters - but Platoon is far more realistic and shocking then both of\\nthose films.  Oliver Stone constantly bombards you with graphic images and\\nemotions never displayed on film at that point in time.  It is a true\\ndepiction of what the Vietnam war (or any war for that matter) was - a\\nmistake.  Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger literally fight for the viewers\\ninnocence - and you feel like you're thrown right into the middle of the\\nbattle.  An amazing achievement.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis one was a great film both in its day and in the present too. Great\\ntension between Berenger and Dafoe, chaotic, brutal battle scenes, stirring\\nmusic, realistic combat footage and drug use, moods, reactions of the\\nfighting men too. Stone was there, this bears the stamp of authenticity.\\nYeah the Berenger/Dafoe conflict is kinda forced; sure Sheen is hardly the\\nbest actor to be at the center of such an important film, and yeah, I know\\nabout the complaints of racism on Stone's parts-black soldiers as cowardly\\naddicts, etc.-but sod it, these things did happen and do\\nhappen.As for the Private Ryan comparison, well-Private Ryan was made for a much\\nbigger budget, it was done on a bigger scale by a very different director in\\na different era. I believed what happened in Platoon more so than in Ryan,\\nsave for the landing/last battle; Speilberg's story arc is just too...I\\ndonno, outta an episode of 'Combat' while 'Platoon' strove for something\\ngreater. I think Stone gets at the heart of the regular grunts better than\\nSpielberg did. Remember, Stevie boy got a college deferment to stay outta\\n'Nam while Stone was right in the thick of the rice paddies. That in itself\\noughta supply all the backing you need for my thinking.I am def. giving this one **** outta ****. 'Bout time.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nPlatoon is certainly one of my favourite war films from any particular era,\\nalthough it doesn\\'t quite reach the same intensity of Apocalypse Now or All\\nQuiet on the Western Front. But it does have a more natural honesty about it\\nthan say Saving Private Ryan.What I particularly liked about the film was the way America wasn\\'t only\\nfighting the Vietnamese but also with the liberals & conscientious-objectors\\nback home AND their own internecine squabbles between the men\\nthemselves.Oliver Stone\\'s script & personal hands-on reflections of his own Tour of\\nDuty don\\'t hark upon the out-and-out conflict against the enemy. Instead he\\ntries to point the camera at the young conscripts themselves. One minute\\nthey\\'re thinking of college educations and a decent, well-paid job; the next\\nthey\\'re out in the jungle being ripped to shreds by lethal blades of long\\ngrass, eaten by ants, blood-sucked by leaches, and that\\'s even before you\\nfactor-in the enemy and their on-the-ground tactical supremacy.Charlie Sheen is at his very best as Chris, the new recruit, or \"Crusader\".\\nA rich kid who volunteered to do his bit for his country, although this\\ncould have been down more to peer pressure than a sense of\\nduty.But through his eyes & words we can see how the war affected so many\\nAmerican men in so many different ways. Fortunately, Stone doesn\\'t go a\\nstage further by incorporating the hateful voices back home who decry the\\ninvasion. It would have been interesting to see Chris\\'s reaction to that\\nkind of \"civil war\" and wondering who side he is really\\non!The (very) ending is perhaps a little contrite & too nicely packaged, which\\nsmells of studio interference; but for the other 99% of the movie I was\\ntotally immersed in the raw energy & emotion these soldiers gave supporting\\na country they probably never knew existed and for a reason they were never\\nproperly told.It could be argued that the film reeks with an air of Stone\\'s typical\\nliberal attitudes, but one thing that can\\'t be forgotten - Stone was out\\nthere fighting someone else\\'s war, he did see action and so who are we to\\ndisagree.****/*****\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\n\"Platoon\" is one of the most realistic war movies ever made.  It deals with\\nthe fact that while Americans were fighting in Vietnam, horrible war crimes\\nwere commited.  In this movie, the main character is Chris Taylor, played by\\nCharlie Sheen, a man who volunteered for Vietnam out of a sense of duty to\\nhis country.  His grandfather fought in the first world war, and his father\\nin the second.  He felt it was also his duty to carry on the tradition. \\nTaylor arrives in country with only a few other new recruits posted in his\\nplatoon.  Everyone expects him to know what to do and how to do it.  When\\nthe platoon is stationed on \"ambush\" in the jungle, they are the ones\\nambushed, by the Vietcong.  The ambush is unfairly blamed on Taylor, by\\npeople saying that it was his fault for sleeping.  In fact, his shift was\\nover, and another soldier fell asleep on the job.  From there on, things get\\nworse, and the platoon ends up burning a suspected Vietcong refuge village\\nto the ground.  Sergeant Barnes shoots an old woman and is about to murder a\\nchild, when Sergeant Elias stops him.  Looting, rape, murder, and arson are\\nall comitted by Americans in that village alone.  It is difficult to watch\\nand you begin no to feel as much sympathy towards the Americans.  War is\\nbad.  Plain and simple, and should be avoided at all costs.  Especially a\\ndifferent country\\'s civil war, such as Vietnam.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nWhen viewing this movie years after it was originally released and having\\nthe oppotunity to see other Oliver Stone projects,it becomes evident that he\\nprobably climaxed with 'Platoon'.Artists from other entertainment\\ndisciplines have produced work that they will always be judged against and\\nwhich they never have surpassed.A case in point is Micheal Jackson's\\n'Thiller'.Although his other offerings are good in their own right,they do\\ntend to pale in comparison.I feel that his later projects suffer as a\\nconsequence and although it may not seem entirely fair,he set his own high\\nstandards with 'Platoon'.There are a variety of factors that make this such a good movie.The first is\\nthe background music which conveys a message of seemingly overbearing\\ntragedy about the loss of innocent young life.The tracks used to capture the\\nera blended in with the screenplay and did not detract from the movie as\\nsometimes occurs with more product oriented movies that choose tracks that\\nwill sell CD's and not to accentuate the mood the director may wish to\\nconvey.The emsemble cast showcased here is very talented and many of them were to\\nmake an impact on the movie scene,most notably Johnny Depp and Charlie\\nSheen.Tom Berenger and William Dafoe play their parts perfectly which is\\nessential since their conflict was a central theme.There were no weak\\nperformances which can usually be to the detriment of a good\\nmovie.My own personal analysis of this picture is that the conflict between Tom\\nBerenger and William Dafoe is a representation of the situation in America\\nduring the Vietnam war.Berenger represented the hard core anti-communist war\\nmachine which viewed American soldiers as part of the machinery to eradicate\\nthe enemy of democracy.Dafoe's character could be seen as the peace loving\\nanti-establishment hippie generation that has a strong moral belief.The\\nfriction between these contrasting ideologies divides the camp and a violent\\nresult was inevitable.This is indicative of ideological differences in\\nAmerica during the war.Whether my interpretation is accurate is not relevant\\nsince it is a thought provoking movie and I am sure that other users will\\nhave they own analysis.This is the magic of the screenplay as a art\\nform.Anybody who enjoys movies most add this masterpiece to their collection.I am\\nsure it will be watched many times over.        \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nWhen this film came out in 86/87 there was so much buzz about it.  Now after\\nFINALLY seeing this film in my adult hood, I can say that the film is good\\nbut not the masterpiece I remember people saying it is..The film is good and has great performances.  It shows war as it truly is\\n'Senseless'.  The soldiers walk around through filth and muck, shoot at\\nshadows, disrespect each other, get killed and dream of getting out.  Its as\\nif there is no method to their madness, and the only way of expressing their\\nfrustration is to murder, rape and pillage.It's also a great accurate portrayl of what I feel IMHO of American soldiers\\nin Nam.  Not the best war film (IMHO Grave of the Fireflies is) ever made\\nbut Platoon makes it's point.Rating 7 out of 10\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\nPLATOON has some religious metaphors in it. ELIAS is a messianic figure of\\nsorts, BARNES is the devil and CHRIS TAYLOR is the soul caught between the\\ntwo factions. The Elias messianic overtones come out in the scene where\\nElias gets shot to death by the VC and he reaches his arms toward the\\nsky...if you\\'ve read the script it\\'s quite clear what Stone was doing. I\\'m\\nnot saying this film is a \"christian\" film, however, for decades artists\\nand\\nwriters have drawn on the Bible for metaphors (ie. THE SHAWSHANK\\nREDEMPTION)\\nnot only does this enhance their project but it\\'s cool in a artsy kind of\\nway.

I\\'m not over-reaching...Stone has talked about this\\nin interviews and it comes out in the script. One problem PLATOON does\\nhave,\\nis that it trys to explain Vietnam in two hours...one cannot do this.\\ndespite this flaw. PLATOON deserved every Oscar it won.

The story line\\nis not hard to figure out but the decisions Sheen's character has to make\\nthat are. It's a basic story of Good (Defoe) vs Evil (Berenger). This was\\nalso a summation about Stone's own experiences during Vietnam.

But what is especially appealing about \"Platoon\", I think,\\nis\\nthe way in which Stone deglamourises war,while simultaneously giving the\\nviewer an exhilarating, claustrophobic, and ultimately cathartic\\nexperience.In turn I felt both thrilled and horrified, emotionally evoked\\nand saddened.  Particularly moving scenes,to name a few, which the viewer\\ncan never forget, include the village, Elias\\' death, and the apocalyptic\\nending- when the perimeter is overrun. The acting too is top class.\\nCharlie\\nSheen\\'s Taylor gives a credible performance as Stone\\'s alter ego, but\\nespecial praise must go to Tom Berenger\\'s depiction of the war scarred\\nBarnes, and  Willem Defoe\\'s sensitive Elias, as well as supporting roles,\\nsuch as Kevin Dillon\\'s sadistic Bunny, and Chris\\' big brotherly Keith\\nDavid\\nas King,all make up the tragedy and horror that was Vietnam.

       " u'\\n\\nFirst of all, I think Platoon is one of the 5 best war movies (dealing with\\nthe fighting itself) that I\\'ve ever seen.  What I don\\'t understand is why\\neveryone compares this to Saving Private Ryan (many times saying SPR is a\\nbetter movie!).  The two are not even comparable.  Saving Private Ryan is a\\n50s \"war\" movie updated for the 90s with appropriate bloodletting and a weak\\nplot.  Platoon is the great emotional (where Apocalypse Now was the surreal\\nand Full Metal Jacket was the cold/uncaring) look at the horrors of fighting\\nin the Vietnam War.  The struggle between good and evil for Taylor\\'s soul is\\njust about the most effecting \"personal battle\" in a war movie.  People are\\ncomparing this (based on fact!) to the fictional story of a bunch of guys\\nwho go looking for another guy \\'cause the Chief of the General Staff (can\\nyou believe it!?!) wants them to.  Along the way Spielberg tries to mix the\\ngo get\\'em of postwar action films with the horrors of war.  That doesn\\'t\\nwork.  Platoon does, very well.  In fact SPR is so uneven it\\'s hard to\\nbelieve that a veteran director directed it (not that Spielberg is a great\\none but he does have the experience).\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nIf Platoon is not the best war film ever made, it is the best Vietnam war\\nfilm ever made.While I must give homage to \"Saving Private Ryan\" for its ingenious battle\\nscenes, this film, in perspective is far better.While previous commentors stated that the plot was somewhat sketchy, I\\ntotally disagree. At first It seems sketchy, however, as one watches the\\nfilm, one realizes that it is a film of a great plotline. It is a modern\\ntragedy. Sheen entering a war for honor ends up torn between the choice of\\nbecoming a savage, or keeping the little honor that he has left in the war\\nsymbolized by Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sgt. Elias (Willhelm Dafoe).\\nAs\\nthe war progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to keep honor in\\nwar\\nas both Sergeants tear apart the Platoon as their ideologies conflict. The\\nfinal sequence in the film is remarkably done, as Taylor (Charlie Sheen)\\nchooses one path and ironically becomes the opposite.Saving Private Ryan, on the other hand, is just about a couple of guys who\\ngo into France looking for Private Ryan. What makes this film great, were\\nthe ingenius action sequences of the film.While currently Saving Private Ryan stands out as the best war\\nfilm ever made. I believe that it will become dated from replication of\\nsimilar techniques in other films. Plot of Saving Private Ryan is somewhat\\nweak, as well as its character development compared to Platoon.Platoon is a great film of various issues that intertwine within each\\nother.\\nIs there honor in war? What happens to men in war? Good vs. Evil... what\\neventually wins in war? Are there any positive aspect in war? etc...\\netc...As well as little issues that give it a distinct Vietnam persona.\\nWhy\\nare a larger porportion of African Americans in Vietnam than whites? Do\\nLieutenants straight out of West Point deserve the same homage and\\nresponisbilites as a hardened Sergeant with several years of experience in\\nthe field. The frustration of guerilla warfare tactics on a superior\\nmilitary strength. etc... etc...Anyways, this film is on my top ten list of greatest films ever made. And\\nnumber one in my best war film ever made category, while Saving Private\\nRyan\\ncomes second.\\n',\n",

Saving\\nPrivate was excellent but the it was very unlikely for about 8 guys\\nhunting\\nfor 1 guy in a whole country, but in this movie you have a full platoon in\\na\\nwar.

Platoon answers that question by giving you the\\nchance to witness the brutal side of man (Staff Sgt. Barnnes) and the more\\nhumanistic side (Sgt. Elias).

       " u'\\n\\n  It didn\\'t take long for Oliver Stone to make a name for himself. \\nBeginning with his Oscar-winning script for \"Midnight express\", he has\\ncontinued making great scripts and movies all along the years.  However, not\\nthat many people knew him or followed his career even after he won that\\nOscar except for his biggest fans.  So \"Platoon\" could be considered to be\\nhis breakthrough movie and not only because it won Oscars for best picture\\nand a best director one for him, but because it was really good.   Chris (Charlie Sheen) has dropped out of college to volunteer for the army\\nto go to Vietnam.  But once he gets there, he realizes that the war really\\nisn\\'t how he thought it might be.  He sees the horrors of the war and lives\\nthem as well.  Also, there are two sergeants in his platoon and they are\\ncomplete opposites; Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) is a crazy man who kills\\nany Vietnamese person as soon as he or she is in site.  And then there is\\nSergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) who is completely against the war and probably\\nwouldn\\'t be there if he had a choice.  And so there is this hate rivalry\\nbetween Barnes and Elias.  Barnes even goes as far as killing Elias in a\\nvery cowardly way.  Throughout the movie, there is Sheen\\'s voice-over telling his experiences\\nwith the intermediate of letters he writes to his grand-mother.  The movie\\nis a biography of Stone\\'s experience in Vietnam and you can see how he just\\nhated the war and considered it incredibly stupid.  The scenes in the\\nVietnamese villages are very powerful and the whole movie is very well\\ndirected.  I think that it\\'s Berenger who steals the movie however with his\\nexcellent incarnation of the crazy Sergeant Barnes.  Globally, this is an\\nexceptional movie and even though it\\'s very rough and a little gory\\nsometimes, I still recommend it to any movie-buff who hasn\\'t yet seen it. \\nIt IS exceptional.\\n',\n",

This film is the sort of same obvious allegory\\nas in Nathaniel Hawthorne\\'s \"Young Goodman Brown\"  The theme of this film\\nis\\nthe actual transformation and developement of an ordinary young adult into\\nan unrecognizable gun toting, desperate and terrified soldier. Oliver Stone\\nuses allegory not realism to illustrate this. Let me explain...\\nThe character of Chris, sticks out like a sore thumb, he is an exaggerated\\neveryman. To give Sheen and Stone credit, It can\\'t be that Sheen is just a\\nbad actor who can\\'t insert the word \"mother f***er\" convicingly during a\\nconversation. We are meant to identify with Chris, e.g. Chris\\'s predictable\\nnarration/letter to his (who else) grandmother. Stone has built this\\ncharacter with a familiar framework of conflicts e.g. his family is divided\\nover his being there, he enlists, then regrets enlisting and says he made a\\n\"big mistake\". I can\\'t be just bad writing, it has to be intentional. I\\'m\\nsurprised the character wasn\\'t named Pvt. Chris EverymanAlso, if this film is meant to be viewed as realistic, it fails because it\\nuses familiar cliches we\\'ve already seen in other war films that Stone must\\nhave seen. For example, the scene where they are all smoking grass while\\n\"White Rabbit\" is heard in the background, seems to be customary in post\\nVietnam War film. The actual horror of war sequence in \"Platoon\" is the\\nscene where they shoot up Village residents and destroy their village. The\\ntheme of horror was better illustrated in the same scene in Apocalypse Now\"\\nor even the trench scenes in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930).\\nPersonally, \"Casualties of War\" best illustrates the CONSEQUENCES of what\\nwar will drive men to. In \"Platoon\" what is important is the obvious\\nJeckyll/Hyde dual nature of Everyman Chris that is brought out by his\\nVietnam experience. Charlie Sheen\\'s brilliantly acted character changes\\nright before our eyes and we can see how this once innocent lamb of a\\nperson\\nwho can be you and me can find himself unrecognizable. Therefore \"Platoon\"\\nis brilliant in it\\'s portrayel of that metamorphisis. It shows it fully\\nfrom\\nstart to finish. and it is this that is perhaps sets this movie apart from\\nother films. \"Full Metal Jacket\" touches upon it but never fully develops\\nit\\nas in this film.\\n\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nI would honestly have to say there aren\\'t many movies that surpass platoon.\\nIt\\'s one of my all time favorites.Although it can\\'t be compared in any way other than it\\'s being a war film,\\nto \"saving Private Ryan\". World War II and Vietnam are 2 exactly opposite\\nwars, and because they\\'re nothing alike, the movies can\\'t be compared to\\none\\nanother, the people acted different, the soldiers weren\\'t the same breed,\\nand the mentality of everyone was different.Sometimes people forget that movies are based on reality, not\\nfantasy.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nAs an army officer with 36 years of service in both active and reserve\\ncomponents, I deplore the low ranking enlisted man's view of the war as\\ngospel.  As for fragging it was the junior officer who was killed by the\\nenlisted man.As for the action, time must be compressed so that a composite of actions\\nis\\nportrayed and that license is permitted.  Viet Nam was not much of a war\\n(compared to WW II) but it was the only  one we had.  We were\\ninsufficiently\\nruthless in the conduct of the war in Viet-Nam.  Hanoi was never made to\\nlook like Hamburg, Dresden or Tokyo, that is bombing!!!!!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nWhen one considers all the elements of film making: plot, acting,\\nmusic, photography, directing, etc. this is the best movie ever made.\\nIt is so realistic that it brings the point home about how awful war\\nreally is.After seeing this movie, I began to appreciate how incidents such as\\nthe My-Lai massacre could occur.I feel that \"Saving Private Ryan\", and the \"Longest Day\" (about D-day)\\nfalls short of \"Platoon\" overall.Some of the scenes such as Charley Sheen freezing from fear while\\nwatching the enemy approach through the underbrush was extraordinary\\nand shows that one scene is worth more than 10,000 words.I first wrote the above review after seeing the movie in 1986.I have this movie on Blu-ray and even after seeing it more times than I\\ncan remember, still consider it the best movie I have ever seen. Better\\nthan \"Schindler\\'s List\" and \"Godfather\" which are the only other movies\\nI have given 10s to. Since this is such a sober and somber subject, I\\nhave to be in the mood to watch it, so unlike a lighter or more\\nuplifting movie, have not watched it as much as a lower quality movie I\\nlike such as \"Good, Bad, and Ugly\", or \"Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" or\\n\"Vacation\".Even now, I am still stunned by the incredible realism of the actions\\nin the movie and usually get tears in my eyes during the latter half of\\nthe film. Perhaps I feel this way since it was my generation that lost\\nso many good people in the Vietnam War including some friends,\\nclassmates, and neighbors not only as war casualties, but the lingering\\neffects from Agent Orange, drug use that started during the quiet times\\nof the conflict, etc.. I feel so lucky that I was not drafted to go\\nthere even though my draft number was in the top third of the drawing.\\n',\n",

Thoroughly deserving of its Oscars, compared to\\nSP Ryan Platoon is by far the better movie.10/10.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI saw this movie on its opening day in 1986 in great anticipation and was\\nnot disappointed. A movie truly worthy of the honor \"Best Picture\",\\nPlatoon\\nfamiliarized war without trivializing it.The effectiveness of this film lies almost entirely in its cinematography.\\nWe are chucked into the center of the Vietnam jungles with the soldiers\\nand\\ndirector Oliver Stone finds the exact method to re-create the chaos. We\\nnever see the enemy - unlike most other movies of its kind, Platoon keeps\\nthe enemy hidden and leaping at you from all corners. I sat in my chair,\\nmouth agape and horrified within 10 minutes of the start of this movie and\\nit is this simple technique that creates the effect.Platoon is a towering technical achievement and also an outstanding story\\nof\\nloyalty (personal and to your country) and betrayal - well acted and\\nbrilliantly cast.This is a film that will linger with you for months - in the same way\\nSaving\\nPrivate Ryan or Schindler\\'s List did (or at least should have). Platoon is\\neasily worthy of mention with those two films, or any other. **** out of\\n****.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is the best war movie I have seen.  While many regard Saving Private\\nRyan to be the best, I beg to differ.  I really don't know which film is\\nmore accurate, but I certainly feel that this movie had much more emotion.\\nThe mood was just perfect, and very raw.  I have seen this movie once, and\\nI\\ndon't know if I could see it again, simply because it is so hard on the\\nemotions.  But if you haven't seen it yet, go out and rent it as soon as\\npossible.\\n\",\n",

Without it, there would have been no\\npicture.This movie set the modern standard for cinematic portrayal of\\nwar.After it was released there were dozens of Nam-flick knock-offs and T.V.\\nshows in the late \\'80s, which goes to show the big need for a catharsis\\nfrom\\nthe \\'60s generation about VietNam, especially for those who actually went\\nthere.After 10-odd years in which Stone\\'s paranoia has become a Hollywood\\ncliche,\\nplus a new generation that yawns at \"Platoon\"\\'s level of violence, it\\nstill\\nholds up as a simple coming of age story, horrifically\\ntold.\\n',\n",

That never happened again until Shindler\\'s List.  I was 18 at\\nthe top, prime drafting age and thought of war as exciting and would jump\\nat\\nthe chance.  After watching Stone\\'s Platoon I was completely scared of war\\nand had a real \"fall from innocence\".  The movie gets bashed often, I\\nthink\\nbecause of the distaste for Oliver Stone that many people seem to share.\\nThe movie is really good on its own and is Charlie Sheen\\'s best\\nwork.\\n',\n",

The soldiers don\\'t know whether or not their enemies\\nare\\nhiding in the village.  Seconds later, an angry Vietnamese woman yells at\\nthe American soldiers, claiming that nobody has done anything wrong.  Her\\nhusband is being held in question, and her daughter is yelling with the\\nother children at the American soldiers.  Then, out of anger, the American\\nsergeant draws his gun and shoots the woman dead.  This scene has caused\\nme\\nto cry my eyes out every time!  It is one of the saddest things I have\\never\\nseen on a film!  Even now, just writing about it brings tears to my eyes.\\nIt is here that the question of morality and tragedy are brought into\\nview.\\nAnd that is really what Oliver Stone\\'s \"Platoon\" is all about.  Morality.\\nThis film is not easy to watch, not that it should be!  You want to really\\nsee what a painful place war is, without the use of excessive and\\nunnecessary violence, this is it!  It\\'s real, and it\\'s raw, the way it\\nshould be!  Once the main character leaves the scene at the end of the\\nmovie, we feel in equal confusion and pain as he!  The only other films\\nthat\\nbrought me this close to war were \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"Glory\", and \"The\\nDeer Hunter\"!  This is a MUST see!  MUST!  Beware, you will feel bloodied\\nand bruised physically and emotionally after watching this.\\n\\n',\n",

HE SHOULD KNOW!).  One\\nis that I felt much more connected with the characters.  They were not\\npolitically correct (my favorite being the raspy pot head Rhan) they had\\nmore\\ndepth than any of the characters in SPR.  Also, the combat in Platoon did\\nnot feel adventureous, like in SPR.  The enemy was all around, and there\\nwas\\nan intense feeling of horror everytime the shooting started, as you never\\nknew how it would end.An interesting thing to me is that many people say the village scene is\\nunrealistic!?!

There has been much\\ncriticism of Oliver for the village scence.The commander of the 25infy\\ndivision says it NEVER HAPPENED. The same goes for the drugs and other\\nlies. In the time Oliver was serving,Amercia was still behind the war and the\\ntroops were not out of control zombies. I am ashamed of his village scene.I\\nwas not in Nam, so I have no story to tell.The film Platoon must be viewed\\nin this context. It is part fiction and part non fiction. Do your research and\\ndon't always listen to Oliver and his lies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nI thought that this movie was an incredibly realistic look about one\\ngroup of soldiers. A lot of War movies are non-stop, heart-pounding\\naction.\\nBut this movie was more realistic. It showed that the Vietnam war was\\nabout\\nmore than just the battle. It showed man against the elements. The scenes\\nwith the red-ants, snakes, and the jungle made the movie easier to relate\\nto\\nthe characters.\\nI also think this movie is about drugs. It seemed that all the\\ncharacters who were against the actual fighting were the ones getting\\nstoned every night. I think if the soldiers back then would have kept\\ntheir\\nnoses clean, they would have had a much better effect in the Vietnam war.\\nHowever, I think that there is no reason for war, I can't see why we all\\njust don't get along.

       " u\"\\n\\nI've seen them all. Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse\\nNow,\\nDas Boot, Deer Hunter...and the list goes on. Platoon is, by far, the\\ngreatest war movie ever made. It affected me the very first time I saw it\\nin\\n1988, and still affects me even today. Oliver Stone has created one of the\\ngreat cinematic masterpieces of all-time.The praise for Saving Private Ryan is very distressing mostly because most\\nof the good things being said of it are all done better in Platoon\\n(perhaps\\nthat's why Platoon WON for Best Picture). While it wasn't as grisly or\\ngraphic as Saving Private Ryan, I felt utterly more appalled by the\\nviolence\\nand reality of war in Platoon. For the first time, I felt as if I was\\nactually IN the movie, experiencing war as the soldiers experienced it.\\nAnd\\nit was horrifying. I was constantly afraid that the next step would set\\noff\\na trap, or there were Viet Cong soldiers lurking somewhere in the trees.\\nIt\\nwas the most nerve-wracking experience I've ever had in a movie. It scared\\nme more than any horror film I've ever seen, yet, it's that very fear that\\nmakes the ultimate statement in the movie.Stone paints a gruesome picture of war through they eyes of one soldier.\\nCharlie Sheen's subdued performance is perfect for this film. We can\\nliterally see his tranformation from a clueless green soldier to a gritty,\\nexperienced veteran of war. It's a transformation that we as viewers can\\nfollow and understand. We all experience his emotions, fears, and\\ncuriosity\\nabout war. And we are taken along for the ride without any veils pulled\\nover\\nour eyes.This film is far and away the greatest war movie ever. It illustrates both\\nthe good and bad about American soldiers and war in general. War can\\nsometimes turn grown men into monsters. It can sometimes turn monsters\\ninto\\ngrown men. Oliver Stone does a brilliant job in illustrating this. his\\ndecision to narrate the story through Charlie Sheen's character is both\\neffective and brilliant. It provides the audience with an understanding\\nand\\na face to attach the horror to.In so many ways this movie is superior to Private Ryan.

       " u\"\\n\\nOliver Stone's PLATOON accurately lives up to the experience of fighting\\nhard and dying in wartime. Nothing takes place elsewhere on the globe except\\nfor being inside the bloody, torturable action at Vietnam. If you're a\\nveteran of the Army or Marines who still carries a peace sign, then you'll\\nsee why this picture (and as with many others) is gratefully dedicated. This\\nappeared to be a first for the screen, perhaps a step above other war films.\\nIt paints a hair-gripping portrait at fighting during the Vietnam War with\\nstrong attention to graphic details based on extremely true and tense\\nsituations. You might complain that this looks nearly like another 80s war\\naction movie with no real substance, but this put into effect is demanding\\nalong with tensions, pain, and suffering on the battleground, which is\\nconceivably portrayed. Take very careful notice of the end conclusion, which\\nis horrifyingly true! While I'm waiting to see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for the\\nfirst time, this movie was best for starts. PLATOON is a milestone for (yes)\\nOliver Stone. I can't always judge a Best Picture winner to the most\\nsupreme, but let's say it does rank among the few best innovative war\\npictures that stood a long and lengthy test of time. \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis was the best movie I have ever seen.  Oliver Stone's portrayal of the\\nVietnam War was extremely good.  This movie tops over any other Vietnam war\\nmovie ever made.

       " u'\\n\\nI am a Quaker, meaning someone who does not believe in war. My view is that\\nwars are a form of killing of the poor, the lower middle class,  people get\\nkilled because there were no other jobs available to them except to join the\\nmilitary. It is also a form of making money, selling armaments  and the\\nstruggle for power. I might be wrong in that! But that is my\\nopinion.When this movie came out I was in law school and I was fighting my own war\\nat school as law school is much similar to a military regime. I was a basket\\ncase!  This movie put terror in my head!  I was terrified.  I said that I\\nwould never watch a war movie again in my life!  But I have overruled that\\nprinciple.  I felt that Chris, Charlie Sheen,  had made a mistake that he\\nadmits in his letters to his grandmother.  I kept asking myself why is this\\nkid writing to the grandmother and not his mother. I have watched most of\\nStone\\'s movies and had read most books written about him. I sense that this\\nmovie is autobiographic. Stone and his father could not see eye to eye\\non things, his parents got divorced when he was fifteen if I am not\\nmistaken. He felt betrayed because he did not suspect that the divorce was\\ncoming and perhaps decided that he was alone in the world!  When Stone was\\nat Yale he decided to volunteer when he did not have to!  Oh, God!  Bless\\nhis soul!  He believed innocently that he could serve his country. Viet Nam\\nchanged a naive innocent recruit who went to war, and allowed him to see the\\nambiguity of the war.  The platoon started fighting between itself and\\nkilling innocent civilians, because the two sergeants could not get along.\\nThis conflict of choice turns the young recruit into a man that we now know\\nas one the best writers, directors,  producers of our days.  As Chris,\\nStone seems to have his own opinions about things, (Stone is also the only\\nchild and this is an only child syndrome), he comes up with projects that he\\nfeels are the right thing to do and does them alive or dead! Stone parallels\\nChris\\' choice to go to war in his own life. He is very independent. There is\\nalways a price to pay for being independent!  That is clear in\\nPlatoon.I could never come up with stuff that Stone does.  Still after having seen\\nall that atrocity and although his movies are full of violence, he did not\\nlose his faith and tenderness as one can see him in a cameo appearance  in\\nhis movie Salvador, right at the beginning of the movie Stone kisses a\\nlittle boy. Stone has a worldwide view because he himself admits feeling\\nlike a foreigner,  his mother was a French Catholic woman and his father was\\nJewish. This movie is \"one of the best war movies ever made\", and Oscar\\nworthy movie to me.  As a woman, who is not a believer of war, the movie is\\nabout paying the price of our decisions. Chris as well as Oliver Stone did\\nnot have to volunteer to go to Viet Nam. They felt that they could make a\\ndifference as a young men going to war. Stone was wounded and earned a\\npurple heart. The cast in this movie is superb as well as the\\nmusic.This is my parallel perception of the story of Chris/Stone in the platoon .. . I would like to see this movie re-released to be able to watch  in its\\nentirety without cuts.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis Oliver Stone Oscar winner led a wave of gritty Vietnam combat films\\nduring the mid '80's. Rookie marine Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is\\nprojected in one leap from the security of middle America to the blood and\\nsqualor of a war which can never be won.Uncompromising in its use of soldier's language and graphic violence, the\\nplot follows Taylor through a hellish baptism in a platoon made up of\\npsychotics, criminals and plain murderers. Initially he is shunned by the\\nveterans, but slowly develops the skills and traits of a combat Marine -\\nhaving to suspend all thoughts of decent living in the process. Like all\\naround him, the countdown to the end of his tour becomes a\\nfixation.In this no-rules environment, rivalries amongst the men take on brutish\\nproportions and the domineering Barnes (Tom Berenger) battles with a fellow\\nsergeant (Willem Dafoe) with, as far as Barnes is concerned, only one\\nsuitable outcome. From the chilling silence of the jungle to the thunderous roar of full scale\\nbattle, this is a tense film, but with clear moral messages from Stone - war\\nhas no winners.

       " u'\\nThe big question about the Vietnam war is this: What were we doing over\\nthere? Thousands of young men died for no apparent reason. Oliver Stone\\nmakes no direct attempt to answer this question. Every bit of the\\nmovie\\'s action takes place in the jungles of Vietnam around 1967 and\\n1968. However, the horror and madness we see on screen leaves you with\\na sad feeling in your heart and we realize we absolutely did not belong\\nthere, fighting amidst a civil war within a peasant country we knew\\nnothing about. Stone himself fought in the war and this was his\\nexperience, with Charlie Sheen playing his alter ego. As Sheen says\\nduring the closing narration, \"we didn\\'t fight the enemy, we fought\\nourselves.\"Many people have drawn comparisons between PLATOON and Coppola\\'s\\nAPOCALYPSE NOW, a spectacular film in its own right. These are two\\ndistinctly different visions of the war, PLATOON being a gritty,\\ndocumentary-like version with APOCALYPSE the surreal, fictionalized\\naccount. PLATOON is the better war film because of its honest,\\nin-your-face style. Stone utilized hand-held cameras to capture combat\\nin a way never seen before. We get to know the characters of this\\nplatoon and how \\'civil wars\\' probably broke out within American units\\nthemselves. There are no tricky shots, nor do we see any glamorization\\nof war, as seen in such films as THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE. This is not\\nan artistic depiction of Vietnam like APOCALYPSE NOW. It is bloody\\nrealism shown in quite graphic detail, the way it may have been, based\\non Stone\\'s own experiences.The supporting cast is superb, painting a non-stereotypical portrait of\\ntragic characters. Of course, Tom Berenger\\'s \\'Barnes\\' and Willem\\nDafoe\\'s \\'Elias\\', are symbolic of the good and evil that most likely\\nexisted within some units. These two characters are essential to the\\ninner struggles going on in Sheen\\'s \\'Chris\\'. The battle scenes are shot\\nin such a way that we are put right in the middle of the action, seeing\\nwhat the soldiers saw. It is nearly impossible to know where the enemy\\nis and who you are shooting at, and there is a frightening scene\\ninvolving Sheen as the platoon\\'s lookout, who is paralyzed with fear,\\nunable to act while the enemy creeps upon them. The madness of the war\\nis more emotionally powerful than in APOCALYPSE because we are closer\\nto these events and there are virtually no breaks in intensity.I ask anyone who disagrees with my assessment regarding this film and\\nAPOCALYPSE to watch both back to back. Anti-war films are at their best\\nwhen we are moved emotionally, and I assure you will be more wiped out\\nafter PLATOON. Again, APOCALYPSE is a great movie, however, do you\\nreally care about a fictional mission up a river to kill an insane\\nAmerican? You be the judge. PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN are the two\\nmost emotionally shattering and best anti-war films.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nYes. I love watching platoon. There was some great acting and drama going on\\nwhich was edge of the seat sort of stuff. The elements also played a role\\n(rain etc), which helped to make a convincing movie. Nevertheless, by Oliver\\nStone using a first person perspective, the audience knew the main character\\nwas not going to die, which in turn reduced the thiller nature of the film as\\nwe knew nothing serious was going to happen to SHEEN. Saving Private Ryan\\ngave the impression of a real war with enemies and not know who was going to\\nsurvive. Platoon is a fantastic drama, not about war in itself, rather a\\ncharacter study of the effects of war upon people who are meant to be close\\nto you. The real enemy was within than external. Oliver Stone shows that\\nAmerica can be the enemy with undisciplined soldiers and conflicting leaders\\nwhich made the movie a classic which it is.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nTo me, this was a surprise from Oliver \"Reagan-is-a-fascist\" Stone.  One of\\nthe few Vietnam flicks that gives a fair account of what it\\'s like to fight\\non the ground in a war run by strategy-free nitwits, though Mr. Stone\\nprobably didn\\'t intend it that way.  The personal conflicts and dilemmas\\ncome across as real and plausible, without the usual Hollywood pacifist\\nmoralizing--until we get Charlie Sheen\\'s sentimental (and dead wrong)\\nvoice-over at the very end.

       " u\"\\nIts hard to know where to start with such a breathtaking film. Oliver\\nStone's Platoon is quite simply the best Vietnam war film ever made in\\nmy opinion. Everything about it is as close to perfection as we are\\nlikely to see. Charlie Sheen plays the lead, and Willem Defoe and Tom\\nBerenger play the two sergeants that form a key part of the plot.Chris Taylor (Sheen) is torn between the sergeants. Barnes (Berenger)\\nis the battle hardened, brutal murderer, who uses the war as an excuse\\nto tender to his sadistic pleasures. Elias (Defoe) is the other side of\\nthe spectrum. We get the sense that he has wrestled with his inner\\ndemons, but he has successfully come through to the other side. He has\\ncompassion for his fellow man, and he uses drugs as a form of escapism\\nfrom this brutal war. The two symbolise the struggle that Taylor must\\nface if he is to survive out in Vietnam.Oliver Stone perfectly captures war. The shooting is frantic and\\nimpossible to follow. It perfectly disorientates us, just as the\\nsoldiers were. We have no idea who is being shot at, and neither do\\nthey. We follow the war at ground level, and see the brutalities first\\nhand. Having served in Vietnam, the film is loosely based on Stone's\\ntime out there, and Taylor loosely based on himself.Full Metal Jacket showcases how inhumane the war was, Apocalypse Now\\nturns it into a story about life in general, and hopelessness, but\\nPlatoon has everything. Trying hard to avoid the old clich\\xe9, but if you\\nonly watch one war film, make sure it is this one. Nothing else can\\ncome close.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nOliver Stone wrote the story based upon his experiences as a U.S.\\ninfantryman in Vietnam to counter the vision of the war portrayed in\\nJohn Wayne's The Green Berets entitled,Platoon.It stars Tom Berenger,\\nWillem Dafoe and Charlie Sheen together with Forest Whitaker,Francesco\\nQuinn,John C. McGinley,Richard Edson and Kevin Dillon.It is war film\\nwritten and directed by Stone,which is the first of his Vietnam War\\ntrilogy, followed by Born on the Fourth of July; and Heaven & Earth.Platoon is a brutally realistic look at a young soldier's tour of duty\\nin Vietnam. Chris Taylor is a college student who quits school to\\nvolunteer for the Army in the late '60s. He's shipped off to Vietnam,\\nwhere he serves with a culturally diverse group of fellow soldiers\\nunder two men who lead the platoon: Sgt. Barnes, whose facial scars are\\na mirror of the violence and corruption of his soul, and Sgt. Elias,\\nwho maintains a Zen-like calm in the jungle and fights with both\\npersonal and moral courage even though he no longer believes in the\\nwar. After a few weeks, Taylor begins to see the na\\xefvet\\xe9 of his views\\nof the war, especially after a quick search for enemy troops devolves\\ninto a round of murder and rape. This movie excels in the sense that it is a grunt's-eye view of the\\nwar, touching on moral issues but focusing on the men who fought the\\nbattles and suffered the wounds. It resembles older war movies more\\nthan its Vietnam peers, as it mixes familiar elements of on screen\\nbattle with small realistic details: bugs, jungle rot, exhaustion,\\nC-rations, marijuana, and counting the days before you go home together\\nwith a contemporary sensibility and the psychological effects it has\\nbrought to the soldiers involved.Also,the cast involved were brilliant\\nin their performance.It is a masterpiece, once seen, will never be\\nforgotten, and, at least for those who were not in Vietnam, will\\nforever alter the way in which the war is considered.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nOliver Stone\\'s politics are no secret, but at the same time it would be\\ndifficult to characterize any film about the Viet Nam conflict as\\nanything but anti-war. \"Platoon\" takes that idea and personalizes it in\\nthe battle of wills between two diametrically opposed warriors - Tom\\nBerenger\\'s sadistically ruthless Sergeant Barnes, and Willem Dafoe\\'s\\nhumanistic Sergeant Elias. Charlie Sheen\\'s character, Private Chris\\nTaylor, serves as the viewer\\'s moral arbiter between the two,\\nattempting to make some sense of the untenable situation he finds\\nhimself in once he sets foot in the jungles of Viet Nam. We share his\\nthoughts as he writes home to his grandmother, realizing that his noble\\nideals will be severely tested, while coming to an early conclusion\\nthat \\'Hell is the impossibility of reason\\'.For me, a picture like \"Platoon\" conveys the utter insanity that drives\\nsome men to do the kinds of things in war that would never even be\\nconsidered in \\'ordinary\\' life. The character of Bunny (Kevin Dillon) is\\na prime example. You have a young kid with little or no education,\\nplucked from an ordinary and safe home environment, suddenly thrust\\ninto a situation of terrorizing foreigners at the point of a gun. Where\\ndoes his kind of rage and brutality spring from? What makes Bunny so\\ndifferent from Chris Taylor, willing to waste a village while others\\nshudder in horror at the mere thought? \"Platoon\" doesn\\'t try to answer\\nthose kinds of questions, but boldly puts them out there for the viewer\\nto consider.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThose are the words from the last lines of the movie. The movie that\\ntoday is seen as one of the most accurate Vietnam War movies. Directed\\nby Vietnam vet O. Stone, Platoon is a very emotional story about war\\nand about ordinary people who try to survive during it. Stone tried to\\nmake a war movie that would not be a fantasy, legend or metaphor but\\nsimply a memory of what he had seen in Vietnam. As far as I am\\nconcerned, he succeeded in every way. Main stars of the film are Ch.\\nSheen (echo to his father's role in Apoclapyse Now), W. Dafoe and T.\\nBerenger.Platoon's storyline is very simple. A young recruit Chris Taylor\\n(Charlie Sheen) comes to Vietnam in order to serve his country. He is\\nfull of hopes and patriotism. However, soon Taylor realizes that war is\\nnot a fairy tale. He confronts horrors of war and faces the moral\\ncrisis. Chris searches for someone to lean on and finds himself in\\ncrossfire between two commanding officers Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) and\\nSgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). Before long, Taylor has to decide which\\nones views he finds more reasonable.While it is obvious that the storyline is not a very strong one,\\nmovie's strength lies in other places. One of them is the collision of\\ntwo very strong personalities \\x96 Sgt. Elias and Sgt. Barnes. Firstly,\\nneither of them is a typical war hero that we are used to see in\\nmovies. Sgt. Elias is a compassionate and charismatic leader who is\\nexperienced enough not to lose his mind and to defend his beliefs,\\nhowever he is not perfect either and we see him doing drugs to escape\\nfrom this war. Barnes is a veteran sergeant with many scars on his face\\n(one of the characters says that he was hit seven times). His bravery\\nand combat skills are undeniable and his men even believe that he\\ncannot be killed. Barnes does not do drugs, he is a kind of man that\\nbravely stands up to reality and does not hide from it. However, he has\\nhis dark side either \\x96 he saw so much in his life that killing is\\nnothing more but a necessity for him. When we see both of these\\ncharacters on the screen, we can sense the tension between them and it\\ntakes movie on a higher level.When there is no fighting and no Sgt. Elias or Sgt. Barnes on the\\nscreen, the story revolves around a bunch of young freshmen. Their\\nmetamorphosis from frightful rookies to solders is one of the most\\ninteresting things in Platoon. It amazes and scares how war changes and\\nsplits people. Even though all rookies seem to be different\\npersonalities, they all go through the same path during the war and\\nonly at the end of this path, they become real soldiers. In this movie,\\nwe are shown that there only are three kinds of real solders \\x96 hardy\\nand cruel (like Barnes), fearful and weak (like Sgt. O'Neill (John C.\\nMcGinley)) and there are some who manages to keep their sane mind and\\nbecome brave and calm solders like Elias.To sum up, Platoon is an overwhelming war drama that helps us to feel\\nwhat war really feels like and shows what war does to people. It is not\\na movie full of special effects or a philosophical journey to human\\nheart and sometimes the simplicity of the story annoys a bit. However,\\nit is a human drama than can and should be seen by every grown up\\nbecause of its anti-war message.2011-06-22\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nOliver Stone directed a trilogy of Vietnam war films and the first was\\nPlatoon. It became his most critically acclaimed of the three war\\nepics, and one of his most acclaimed films of all time. Platoon follows\\na platoon of men in Vietnam as they battle the Viet Cong, the jungle,\\nand themselves. Stone makes sure to include every bit of gut wrenching\\ndrama he can, pumping this film full of brutally emotional scenes. This\\nis a true film about war and the men involved in it.Platoon is essentially your most down to earth war film in spite of\\neverything. It is brutal and some of the atrocity and harrowing\\ndestruction witnessed in this film is unreal, but it truly captures the\\nbrutality of the Vietnam war, and I feel like that is this films main\\ngoal. This film chronicles the immediate effects of war on the men\\nparticipating, as the entire film takes place in Vietnam there is\\nalmost always fighting going on. The film sets its focus on the war\\nitself and the individuals fighting, as we get to know each of the\\ncharacters in this film, some better than others. You can tell that\\nthis is a soldier's film and nothing else, as the film is even\\ndedicated to the brave men who fought in Vietnam.As a personal opinion on taste, Platoon doesn't quite hold up to some\\nof my favorite war films. I myself am fascinated by the idea of war and\\nthe effects it has on the minds of men, and Platoon doesn't examine\\nthis as much as other war films. But like I said, this is solely a film\\nabout war, while films like The Deer Hunter, a masterpiece in my book,\\nexamines the relationships of people and how war effects the before and\\nafter. Then you have a movie like Apocalypse Now, the greatest war film\\never made, which is really a movie about the horror and atrocity\\nmankind can inflict, and it only uses the Vietnam war as a backdrop.\\nPlatoon doesn't go as deep as these films, and really only strives to\\nbe an eccentric visual experience that tells the story of war and the\\nmen involved.Where Platoon shines the brightest is its incredible visuals. This\\nmovie captures the sights and sounds of the fighting in Vietnam with\\nthe utmost brutality. Stone masterfully shoots the jungle in both day\\nand night, rain and shine. He completely deserved the Oscar he received\\nfor directing this film. He manages to keep all of his frames tight and\\nclear, depicting a view of Vietnam that is very focused and difficult\\nto look away from, no matter how much you want to at times. However\\nintense you think this film is going to be, it is more than that.Platoon is far from one of my favorite war films of all time, but I\\ncan't deny that it is a masterfully made film. As a movie about war and\\nsoldiers it is masterful, but it doesn't quite reach that deeper, more\\nsubjective, level that other Vietnam films do. But it still quite the\\ncinematic war experience.\\n\",\n",

I was a Combat Engineer in direct support of the\\nInfantry (3rd Brigade) and went everywhere that the Infantry went and\\nfought along side each other during combat action.The movie was about pre-Tet Offensive combat action during Operation\\nYellowstone, January 1968. Oliver did an excellent job of rein-acting\\nthe combat action. He labels the movie as \"fiction\", but it is NOT.\\nOliver did change a few things, though. 1) he changed the time-frame of\\nthe big battle to the last part of the movie. Actually, the battle took\\nplace earlier, January 2, 1968, at Forward Fire Support Base Burt.\\nOliver had to do that in order to make sure the climax of the movie was\\nthe last action to take place. That would have been premature in the\\nsequence of the movie to have it upfront in the movie. The battle was\\ncalled the Battle of Soui Cut. And, 2) the enemy was NOT North\\nVietnamese Army (Regulars, (NVA)). They were strictly Viet Cong (VC). I\\nwalked over the dead bodies of about 382 enemy Viet Cong soldiers.\\nThere were zero (0) NVA soldiers fighting at this battle, only VC. I\\nsuppose Oliver changed that because NVA soldiers may seem more combat\\nworthy, more dynamic and exciting for the movie. With those two\\nchanges, yes, it was fiction, but everything else was non-fiction and\\nfactual. About 30 US soldiers died that night with a few hundred\\nwounded in-action.The meaning of the movie was how soldiers interact with one another\\nduring highly stressful combat, day after day. Its not pretty. I saw\\nthe same thing as soldier fought with one another. Thats reality.Hats off to Oliver Stone for finally making the movie in 1986, 18 years\\nafter his Vietnam experience.

But Platoon should be\\nacknowledged for presenting the most sincere vision of war. Oliver\\nStone who's a Vietnam veteran, fully utilizes his war experience to\\nwrite an impressive screenplay, following through with assured\\ndirection.Platoon also triumphs in the area of photography (highlighted by the\\ntense sequence when the Vietcong steps out of the shadows during a\\nnight in the jungle, hunting the unsuspecting Americans), and\\nshowcasing forceful human drama (the village scene is unforgettable).\\nOliver Stone films Platoon in a way that makes viewers feel uneasy,\\nunknowing of the dangers lurking that might result in deaths for the\\nsoldiers at any time.

       " u\"\\nChris was once a rich kid, but he drops out of college and enlists to\\nfight in Vietnam, Chris {Charlie Sheen} is a raw and green recruit, but\\nin his platoon he finds a mighty division.

Elias {Willem Dafoe}, an adroit leader who retains his\\nhumane sensibility, Chris finds he is the centre of a battle for his\\nsoul, the horrors of war now taking on another deadly battle.Director Oliver Stone has throughout his career ruffled feathers, he is\\nthe perennial fly in the ointment to critics and fans alike, what isn't\\nin doubt is that when he gets it right, he leaves most others in his\\nwake, and with Platoon he grabbed the proverbial scruff of Vietnam's\\nneck and shook it senseless. Stone uses his own experiences of being in\\nVietnam to assault our senses, realism pores out from every crevice of\\nPlatoon's limbs. What Stone achieves best is the constant sense of fear\\nand dread amongst the soldiers, this is no recruitment drive for the\\narmy, this is the raw and petrified fear of reality, as the tension\\nmounts the locale becomes stifling, our nerve ends preparing to be\\nshredded, whilst visually, Platoon also finds Stone on top form, Robert\\nRichardson's cinematography an incredibly tight allied force.There are many Vietnam films available to view, and all have something\\nto offer in varying quality, all are important in helping a nation\\nunderstand via the camera just what the hell, the hell Vietnam was!,\\nbut to me Platoon feels grounded in fact, the village massacre at the\\nepicentre of Stone's movie an obvious reference to the real My Lai\\ntragedy, it's merely one part of a whole that makes Platoon a haunting\\nexperience.

       " u\"\\nIt takes a master filmmaker like Oliver Stone to find real beauty in\\nchaos. The two are of course polar opposites, and yet the talented\\ndirector fuses them in a movie that is both haunting and amazing.I saw this film two years ago when I was only fourteen. Usually I\\nwouldn't make personal comments in a review, but I think its important\\nto understand what effect this movie had on me. I was young and knew\\nthat I wanted to be a filmmaker but it was this film that really\\nencouraged me to make movies. I was spurned on by the artful\\ncamera-work, brilliant screenplay and dynamic acting that, as clich\\xe9d\\nas it sounds, really created an unforgettable screen experience.The movie still haunts me. Despite scenes filled with drug abuse,\\nviolence and an overall sense of menace, there are some moments which\\nspeak volumes to us all. There's an attention to detail usually lacking\\nin war films: characters actually sound like real people instead of\\ncardboard cuttouts.All in all this is a movie I'll never forget.Watch it and you'll see what I mean.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nOne of my favorite Vietnam movies along with The Deer Hunter and\\nApocalypse now. All three movies really outline the impact the Vietnam\\nWar has on a soldier's mind and actions. My favorite quote: Sgt. O'Neill: Bob, I got a bad feeling on this one,\\nall right? I mean I got a bad feeling! I don't think I'm gonna make it\\noutta here! D'ya understand what I'm sayin' to you? Sgt. Barnes:\\nEverybody gotta die some time, Red. The scene where Elias is being shot is the best scene because it really\\nportrays how Elias' tragic death.I also thought that Platoon has outstanding music that really fits into\\nthe mood of the film.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nWhen I first saw this, I felt pretty disappointed in how a sense of the\\nglory of war still seemed to have slipped its way into the mix through\\nthe character of Elias, played by Willem Dafoe. Somehow Dafoe\\'s\\nmoralistic inner-strength and the way he can run into combat to kick\\nbutt without any support because, \"Other people just slow me down,\"\\nseemed incongruous with the overarching point of intensifying the\\ndestructive feelings of fear, stress, and anger felt during combat.However, regarding Elias as a symbol of what the innocent people like\\nChris wanted to believe came out of war helps to reinforce the theme\\nstated at the end of the movie: \"We are in war against ourselves and\\nour enemies are really within us.\" Sergeant Barnes\\' (Berenger) hidden\\nexecution of Elias shows the ultimate destruction of that romantic\\nheroism from within rather than without.It is from that point that the high levels of violence, bodies ripping\\napart, disturbing fights, and harrowing warfare surrounds itself to\\nbecome more than just voyeuristic appraisal of the Vietnam War. Much\\nhas been said about Oliver Stone\\'s involvement in the war and how this\\nmovie was created of his experiences, but I think it\\'s important to\\npoint out that Stone\\'s writing and directing is strong enough that his\\nreputation as a veteran is not the only excuse for the disturbing and\\ndisgusting images of a film that has upon second-thought no inspection,\\nbut contains itself admirably as a parable for the state of American\\npolitics at the time. Sure his use of an almost all-black cast for Sgt.\\nElias\\' half of the troop and all-white cast (a good few with strong\\n\"hick\" accents) for Sgt. Bob\\'s half is a bit heavy-handed, but the\\npoint is still solid.This is also probably a really good film to watch just to cast light on\\na lot of what happens in Stone\\'s other films. Ultimately this is the\\nonly Stone film I\\'ve seen so far that I\\'ve felt comfortable calling a\\n\"Stone film\" because of his strong and specific approach to it. Nothing\\nin this seems as gratuitously extreme, only necessarily extreme.--PolarisDiB\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nIn PLATOON, it shows you the experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam\\nto convey the immediacy of guerrilla warfare. Charlie Sheen stars as\\nChris, a raw recruit, or new meat in the movie a term for new recruits.\\nAt first he wilts under the rigorous conditions of jungle life, freezes\\nup in a firefight, and wonders whether he'll be able to survive. But he\\ngradually adapts and, as time goes by, begins to see that the platoon\\nis divided into two groups. One consists of lifers, juicers, and sub\\nintelligent whites, the other of blacks and heads. Sgt. Barnes, a\\ncombat-loving burnout is the informal leader of the lifers, and Sgt.\\nElias, a free spirit, leads the latter group. When the platoon takes\\nsome gruesome losses while on an o.p., an enraged Barnes kills some\\nVietnamese who may or may not have been VC and orders the burning of\\ntheir village, outraging the temporarily absent Elias. As the conflict\\nbetween these two reaches its tragic denouncement, Chris must decide\\nwhat he really values.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nWar movies are very different. Usually, these differences depend on the\\nfilm-makers' experience with war or knowledge of it. Occasionally, the\\ntime it was made and society's view towards it has its say in the\\nmatter too. This film was made by Oliver Stone, so naturally it's based\\non his experiences in the Vietnam war. Personally, I don't think there\\nis a better war movie than All Quiet on the Western Front from 1979,\\nsimply because it's beautiful, concise and effective without simply\\nshowing lots of stuff blowing up or killing off characters we can\\nrelate to. Despite that, this film is still worth watching, simply due\\nto how well-directed and intense it is. The plot is quite good, and\\nfollows a single platoon through a period in '67, during the Vietnam\\nwar. The pacing is good, though I felt that the film started somewhat\\nslow only to later kick up to a very fast pace for a while. There\\ndidn't seem to be enough character development. I never picked up on\\nall the names. Maybe there are too many major characters. That's\\nsomething I often find in Stone's films, making them quite hard to sit\\nthrough, and requiring more than one viewing to take it all in(which\\nshouldn't be necessary... he's not Kubrick, after all). The acting is\\ngreat. The casting is great, not one character seems miscast. The\\nspecial effects are great. The characters are credible, interesting and\\nwell-written. The direction and editing is talented and effective. The\\nfilm has a few memorable scenes, and the dialog contains a good bit of\\nquotable lines. Not much else to say about the film... it's quite\\ngraphic and very direct, so you should only watch it if you're\\ncompletely certain that you can take it. Oh, and John C. McGinley is\\nexcellent in the film. I recommend this to any fan of anyone involved\\nin the making of the film, Oliver Stone in particular and fans of war\\nmovies. 8/10\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThis film is made by someone who saw the misery in Vietnam with his own\\neyes.With Oliver Stone own experience he showed many people around the world\\nwith this film how life as a US soldier was like in these days.I think this film is a good example about the behaviour of the US in\\nthe Vietnam War.The film showed how some ordinary people can turn into monsters, this\\nis especially the case with Bunny, but also other soldiers are losing\\nthemselves. The film gives a small version of the scandal at My Lai.The scene where Elias gets killed is heartbreaking.The cast is really well chosen and Charlie Cheen and the rest play all\\nvery convincing.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nPrivate Chris Taylor(Charlie Sheen) is a rich kid who dropped out of\\ncollege to do his part for his country by joining the Vietnam War. He\\nis assigned to a platoon that becomes divided into two points of views\\nof two different Sergants: Elias Grodin(Willem Dafoe) and Bob\\nBarnes(Tom Berenger). Along with the battle against the Vietcong, the\\nplatoon battles themselves morally and physically.This movie is one of the rare war movies that actually captured to\\ntotal guerrilla warfare of the Vietnam War. It showed the burning of\\nvillages, digging fox holes, and use of mortars. The movie has two\\ngreat performances with two opposing roles. Dafoe does an amazing job\\nof being the man who was willing to fight for others safety, and\\nBerenger did a great job as the tyrant who believed in what he was\\ndoing when he had to use unethical tactics. The movie also includes\\ngood performances from Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, John C.\\nMcGinley, and Reggie Johnson. Johnny Depp also gets a small little roll\\nin the movie. The movie\\'s writing is wonderful also. There is a scene\\nwhere Dafoe\\'s character talks to Sheen\\'s about how \"the stars have no\\nright or wrong in them, they are just there\". There is also a scene\\nwhere Berenger\\'s character says \"Are you smoking this shi_ so\\'s to\\nescape from reality? Me, I don\\'t need this shi_. I am reality.\" The\\nwriting was just very real and convincing. Overall, this movie is\\nabsolutely wonderful and definitely the best Oliver Stone has ever\\ndone. It is his legacy of movies.I highly recommend this war classic.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ve ever watched a film that depicts a real life\\nsituation as good as this. It is a rare film in that it is complete -\\nthe acting, music, setting and directing are all superb and create an\\namazingly realistic atmosphere. From watching this film, you will not\\nonly be entertained, but you will learn what life was like during the\\nVietnam War. In case you haven\\'t already heard, Platoon is a war film\\nthat presents us with a day-by-day account of young Charlie Sheen, who\\nis struggling to fit in with a group of soldiers, all much older than\\nhim. As you should know, the Vietnam war lasted many years and soon\\nbecame a problem for the American society when the media found out the\\ntruth, and as Walter Kronkite, the news reader said \"What the hells\\ngoing on? I thought we were winning this war!\" (Nope, my gcse in\\nhistory ain\\'t coming out) But this film concentrates on how the\\nsoldiers were feeling, and reacting to the war. Oliver Stone who\\ndirected this film put the actors through their paces by actually\\nmaking them survive in real soldier conditions, were they had to dig\\nthere own homes, avoid sleeping on watch duty, and much more. It proved\\na treat as all the acting in this looks as though the war had started\\nagain. Normally at this point, I would comment on the films special\\neffects, but I\\'ve got a break because this film just uses very\\nrealistic warfare weapons to create the big war scenes. You would think\\nthis would make it a preety low budget movie, but when you see the\\nattention to detail, it must have a long film to shoot. This is a great\\nfilm, but not for the faint hearted. As you would expect from a\\nrealistic film, there is lots of blood and \\'gorey wound\\' scenes. And\\nagain there\\'s a lot of shooting, the saddest part being when the\\nplatoon of troops shoot down a group of innocent villagers due to\\nfrustration. Overall, this is a great film. Good acting and great\\nsurroundings combine with a theme tune that will never escape your head\\nits that sad and catchy, just like the film.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI have to say that Oliver Stone seems to be one of the most\\nmisunderstood directors in the world. What some people don't get is\\nthat one of the main values of an artist is his originality. How HE\\nsees things,how HE creates something. Stone has an OPINION and a TAKE\\non things which he throws in our faces. He is SUBJECTIVE, as all art\\nshould be.All these people here on IMDb that say that Platoon and other\\nStone pictures don't do justice to Vietnam veterans miss the point.This\\nmovie is not only about Vietnam veterans, it is about people in an\\nextreme situation.About feelings, emotions and human behavior.It is\\nfairly historically accurate and it is enough.Dialogues are excellent,\\nas all dialogs written by Stone.Of course you have to FEEL like Stone\\nto really appreciate his movies.You have to connect.If you don't,\\nthat's OK, but don't criticize simply because you don't agree with how\\nhe perceived the events. Acting is brilliant,filming\\nbeautiful,screenplay excellent. You can sense the 100% passion that\\nwent into the making of this movie, and this is the most that you can\\nask from an artist. Europe (generally) loves your movies Oliver, so\\ndon't bother with your shallow and brainwashed compatriots. 10/10\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nA disturbing war film that deserves the praise it gets. This is one\\npowerful film with many shocking scenes that will give you the chills .\\nthe performances are AMAZINGLY good (more on that later). I was\\nactually expecting this to be very overrated but it wasn't at all and i\\nenjoyed it very much even if it was pretty disturbing. This is a very\\nimportant viewing for everyone but it's not pretty and hard to watch at\\ntimes. there is LOTS of graphic violence but not hat much gore. We get\\nsome bloody gunshot wounds, TONS and TONS of bloody corpses , a brutal\\nbeating with a gun, (and what's said after that had happened is very\\ndisturbing). a VERY graphic bloody gunshot wound to the head with blood\\nand brains splattering, and TONS and TONS of very graphic but non\\nbloody gunshot wounds. The acting is Oscar worthy. Charlie Sheen is\\nutterly fantastic and gives an Oscar worthy performance here , he is\\nEXTREMELY likable and did a fantastic job. Tom Berenger is an awesome\\nactor and did awesome here but his character was VERY unlikable.\\nWilliem Dafoe is great here as usual i liked him lots. Forest Whitaker\\nand Johnny Depp both do fine with what they have to do and John C.\\nMcGinley does okay and Kevin Dillon annoyed me. Overall a classic film\\nthat is a required viewing for everyone ***** out of 5 (a true\\nclassic)!!!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nOliver Stone, the man behind JFK, WALL STREET and NIXON just to name a\\nfew, brings forth a film that is very close to his heart in PLATOON.\\nThis film effectively shows us the grind of war, one which Oliver Stone\\nhimself understands well, being a Vietnam vet himself. The combat\\nscenes are not glamorized, each one thrown at us with the purpose of\\nportraying the realities of battle. Saying this, each scene is\\nbeautifully framed, often showing no real battle lines, just confusion.\\nWe are first brought into Vietnam as an outsider, slowly becoming more\\nand more accustomed to the brutality and apathy that exists all around.\\nCharlie Sheen stars in this film (what's with the Sheen's and Vietnam).\\nHe plays an idealistic new recruit who volunteers for combat duty.\\nThrough Stone's genius, we observe the war through the eyes of Sheen's\\ncharacter. We land on an air base, witness the realities of being a new\\nrecruit, watch a horrific event at a village and see how someone can\\nquestion one's own morality. Sheen's character gets off the helicopter\\na very innocent volunteer, not fully understanding of the situation\\nthat exists ahead. Well, that will change of course. Tom Berenger and William Dafoe give extraordinary performances,\\nespecially Dafoe. One image of Dafoe in particular (hint is that it\\ndeals with him throwing his arms in the air) is about as effective as a\\nmovie image can get. As we are taken deeper into the jungle, we are\\ntaken deeper into the subplot that exists between William Dafoe's\\ncharacter and Tom Berenger's. I am not going to give away how this\\ndispute starts but lets just say that it started with a shocking\\nincident. The men are split in support of each one, Sheen being with\\nDafoe. We watch Sheen change into, well, into a man who now has seen\\nthe worst of mankind. The last battle is breathtaking to say the least.\\nBerenger and Sheen share an unforgettable moment, one which will linger\\nwith you long after the credits fade. At the end, the brilliant score\\nunleashes its might and we see Sheen leave on a helicopter, alone with\\nhis thoughts. His monologue at the end puts everything in perspective,\\nwe see Stone's view of the war with it as well. Sheen's character still\\nhas hope though and still strives to see the goodness that exists in\\nlife. Platoon is one of the better films of the 80's and will always be\\nStone's defining film.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nPlatoon is a masterclass of how to make a film with a message. The\\nunderlying theme of Platoon concerns the ultimate horror and sometimes\\nfutility of war. Set in Nam' during the late 60s we follow the war\\nthrough the eyes of a raw young volunteer (Charlie Sheen). Starting out\\nfull of ideology and belief in his cause, his experiences lead him to\\nconclude that war entails enormous and often wasteful sacrifice. At\\ntimes, Platoon is very sad; scores of young soldiers, often friends,\\nbeing slain in combat. We witness the internal rivalries that split an\\narmy, the cynicism that can develop and the differing methods of coping\\nwith battle. Platoon is not a sensationalist war movie. It has a deep\\nstatement that many viewers may resonate with. The action scenes are\\nwell staged and take place very much from the perspective of the man\\n'at the front'. The cast does not feature any major stars, but perhaps\\nbecause of this, Platoon can be viewed without the Hollywood cult of\\npersonality. It perfectly suits its' genre; a war film that plays it\\nstraight. One for any collection.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nIn one sense this can be seen as Oliver Stone\\'s attempt to account for\\nthe massacre at My Lai for which Lt. William Calley was famously\\ncourt-martialed. One recalls a statement made at the time by somebody\\nin close concert with the logic of the Vietnam War: \"We had to destroy\\nthe village in order to save it.\" But more inclusively, Oliver Stone\\'s\\nfilm addresses the question of what war does to us as it focuses on\\nPvt. Chris Taylor, played by Charlie Sheen, who gave up his student\\ndeferment, joined the army and volunteered to fight in Vietnam as his\\npatriotic duty. How the twisted logic of war changes him and corrupts\\nhim and others in his platoon is the story of the film.To Oliver Stone\\'s credit it can be said that this movie, first released\\nin 1989, helped to shock a new generation of Americans into\\nunderstanding just why our involvement in Vietnam was a tragic mistake\\nand to warn us not to do anything like that again. The fact that recent\\nmilitary adventures by the US have been limited engagements with\\nlimited objectives (instead of the vague and unrestricted policy of\\nstopping the spread of communism, which was the rationale for the war\\nin Vietnam)--engagements that have been carefully orchestrated to avoid\\nbecoming mired in the kind of hand-to-hand combat favoring the side\\ndefending its own turf as shown in this film, owes something to Stone\\'s\\nvision and to that of other film makers. One also recalls Senator Barry\\nGoldwater R, Arizona) who advocated \"winning\" the war in Vietnam by\\n\"bombing them back into the Stone Age.\" Stone\\'s film suggests just how\\nimpossible that would have been.Tom Berenger gives a splendid and somewhat horrific performance as Sgt.\\nBarnes, the \"War Lover\" (the phrase is the title of John Hersey\\'s WWII\\nnovel), who kills both friend and foe indiscriminately. Willem DaFoe\\nplays his opposite, Sgt. Elias who is the model of the good soldier.\\nThe rest of the cast gives fine support while the script by Stone,\\npartially from personal experience, is full of authentic dialogue and\\nveracious detail. The clash between our civilized nature and our baser\\ninstincts is well presented.It is impossible to fairly compare this to other excellent Vietnam War\\nmovies such as The Deer Hunter (1978), Full Metal Jacket (1987),\\nApocalypse Now (1979), et al., because they are all so different. I do\\nbelieve that Platoon was more of a throwback to World War II movies in\\nthe sense that it focused on the dynamics of the soldiers immersed in\\nactual battles with the enemy. Yet on the other hand it falls\\ncompletely within the Vietnam War genre by looking beyond the battles\\nto address the larger question of why, and the war\\'s consequences. In\\nWorld War II movies, the why was never in doubt, and the consequences\\nwere not an issue.The theme of this movie has been expressed as the loss of innocence,\\nand that is a fair assessment; but I think it wasn\\'t so much the\\nsoldiers themselves that lost their innocence, although many did, but a\\nnation that lost its. We were a different country before Vietnam. We\\nhave never been the same since, and we will never be the same again.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut\\nto the Chaise Lounge or I Can\\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it\\nat Amazon!)\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI definitely smell an overrated movie here. \"Platoon\" was very good and I\\ndid enjoy it. However, through no fault of its own, many people rave on\\nabout this movie as if it\\'s the be all and end all of cinema. I ended out\\ndisappointed because of the huge expectations I had. It\\'s definitely behind\\nwar movies like \"The Thin Red Line\", \"Apocalypse Now\", \"The Bridge Over The\\nRiver Kwai\", and \"Gallipoli\".Regardless, the above movies and \"Platoon\" are so far ahead of \"Saving\\nPrivate Ryan\" it\\'s a joke.Hey \"Platoon\" (7.5/10) Nice Job Stoney.\\n',\n",

Defoe's character is shot\\ntwice almost point blank by Berringer and yet he manages to survive and\\nstagger around, one assumes this is Stone's attempt at dragging emotion\\nout of his audience, although the emotion was humor and not sadness.\\nThese actors can be grateful that they were so young at the time of the\\nmovie and can use that as their excuse.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nBesides the Holocaust the Vietnam War is pretty much one of the most\\ntouched upon topics in motion picture history. With that being said\\nI\\'ve seen most of them. And to be quite frank I am convinced that this\\nmovie is one of the worst in this particular genre. It lacked a clear\\nstructure (the story was all over the place and felt inconsistent at\\ntimes), there was basically no character development, and the special\\neffects were laughable, to say the least. All of the explosions in the\\nmovie looked like fireworks going off. I kid you not. There were some\\nscenes that I really liked but I can\\'t get over the fact that they were\\nfollowed up by fireworks explosions. In some scenes even the\\nprojectiles were replaced by \"fireworks\". In other words: it looked\\nlike they were shooting plasma beams out of their guns (just like in\\nStar Wars). The only good thing about the movie was the cast. A lot of my favorite\\nactors starred in the movie but that doesn\\'t make up for the\\naforementioned points.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nSo it seems to me that the ideals of Platoon are to be anti-war...to\\nnot ascribe any blame towards the overtly political powers that drove\\nthis war but to centre it on the human aspect of the soldier itself,\\nand how it loses its humanity. Sheen\\'s bleary, self-serious voice- over\\nnarration says so as much - that the enemy was within themselves, the\\nviolence from their own hearts. And Stone collaborates this idea with\\nhis visuals; there is scarcely a clear shot of a Vietnamese soldier,\\nguns blazing. The danger is all around them, but it is murky and\\nindistinct, and the paranoia settles into the platoon quite easily, and\\nbegins to affect them. There is no logic or reason to the madness, to\\nthe hysteria of the violence, to the casual beckoning of death itself\\nafter a few weeks in the jungle. The problem is that Sheen\\'s storyline doesn\\'t fit this message at all.\\nStone tries to avoid pointing the blaming finger, and attempts to rid\\nthe film of any structure or cause or journey just because we might\\nexpect it from a movie. But in doing so he inadvertently creates a\\ncoming-of-age story that just so happens to be set during the Vietnam\\nWar. Taylor goes in a fresh-faced youth, having idealised the soldier\\nlife and cast away the bores of college, and immediately finds himself\\nout of his depth. And then he has to go through the usual rigours of\\ngaining acceptance within the group and finding his feet, and shaping\\nhis own philosophy. The choice that Stone has presented here is a\\ninsultingly simplistic one; the scarred, savage Barnes who shoots first\\nand asks questions later, who Taylor unsurprisingly initially worships\\nand who has half of the platoon following his violent, racist ways. And\\nthen you have the literal hippie, Dafoe\\'s disillusioned, goody\\ntwo-shoes veteran that later befriends Taylor and stops the atrocity at\\nthe village. There\\'s not much engagement even for Taylor - one moment he is\\ndeliriously taunting the villager with his gun and even close to\\nshooting him, and following that, nearly speaks out on the massacre and\\nthen stops the gang-rape of some girls. Stone wants these moral\\ndecisions to be grounded within visceral, graphic images of war, but\\ndoesn\\'t commit to it; the rape is only hinted at from off-screen, and\\nas Bunny smashes the elderly woman\\'s head open, it surely is a sight\\nfor Taylor to recoil from, but we don\\'t see it. Even when the group\\ndiscover the gory end of Manny, Stone spends more time pointing the\\ncamera at the horrified reactions instead. Many critics have praised it for its realism, its fuzzy, indistinct\\nboundaries of warfare that do not glorify the combat, do not make it\\nexhilarating but chaotic and confusing for all involved. But Stone\\'s\\nfilm is full of these cinematic moments that betray his intent -\\nSheen\\'s clich\\xe9-ridden voice-over becomes quickly insufferable because\\nit assumes so much of the other characters without ever giving evidence\\nof their \"heat and soul\". There\\'s that wishy-washy poetic speech from\\nDafoe the night before the chaos and mayhem that just happens to take\\nplace underneath a beautiful star-filled sky and a stupid shooting\\nstar. Later he is the figure of perhaps the worst scene in the film,\\nhis own death, stumbling for his life as he is riddled with Vietnam\\nbullets in slow-motion and Samuel Barber\\'s Adagio for Strings swells to\\npeak sentimentality and it\\'s almost unwatchable.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nAs a pacifist, I don't find myself watching a war movie too often. That\\nbeing said, I found Platoon, the 1986 Best Picture winner written and\\ndirected by Oliver Stone to be an engaging film. I do find myself a fan\\nof Oliver Stone, so I'm sure that helped with my overall assessment of\\nthe film. Platoon tells the story of a college-aged man, Chris Taylor (Charlie\\nSheen) who volunteers for active service during the Vietnam conflict.\\nChris endures what most everyone who saw active duty during the\\nconflict endured, the horrors of death and violence. In addition to the\\nhorrors of war, Chris also endured the moral conflict that was rife\\nthrough Vietnam. He watched entire villages decimated because the men\\nin his platoon thought it was funny. he witnessed one member of his\\nplatoon, Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) stand up for the injustices they\\nwere witnessing, only to be murdered by another member of the platoon,\\nSgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger). The conflict can't end soon enough for\\nChris after all that he has seen.Oliver Stone goes to great lengths in this film to show the horrors of\\nwar often ignored in American media; the mistreatment of people in the\\ninvaded country. It was an important light to shine on the reality of\\nwar. Stone himself, being a Vietnam veteran, focused carefully on this\\nissue, showing war's horrors without assessing blame on the individuals\\nperforming the attacks. Stone isn't seeking to blame the soldiers\\nthemselves, but rather take a systemic look at the realities war\\nbrings. I will probably never watch Platoon again, but I am happy to\\nhave seen it at least once.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nI always found it odd that people spoke about PTS - it was only after\\nwatching Platoon that I truly realised what PTS is. The film shows us\\nthe kind of atrocities simple people like you and me carry out when in\\na war like situation that they are simply not prepared for. The same is\\nperhaps also true for people in riots, civil strife and similar\\noccurrences. The way their inner conscience probably eats them up every\\nliving day, once they are out of the situation, is what Platoon reminds\\nus of.Set in the Vietnam war, Platoon traces out the experiences of a young\\nenlisted soldier. Mostly based on the director\\'s own experiences in\\nVietnam, the movie reminds us in an honest yet gruesome manner the\\nworst of war - and that there is nothing else to war.\"Platoon\" should be mandatory viewing for every US, French and British\\ndiplomat and army man. Perhaps then they may learn something and we may\\nhave a world with a few less wars \"created\" by nations such as theirs.Warning: The movie is heavy in content. I had to watch it in a few\\nseparate sittings simply to preserve my own sanity!\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThe movie's story unravels a bit slow at the opening stages although\\nwith all those strong images of war. The story gets more interesting\\nabout half way the movie plays by depicting the internal conflict.. The\\nset, props and makeup are done nicely, even for that particular time of\\nthe movie's production. The things that lack quite a bit are the sound\\nand visual effects. The sound doesn't really give the real feel of\\nstereo location placing, a technology that wasn't yet available. Yet\\nthe visual effects look somewhat too much forced, like we see on the\\nlightning scene. The use of throwing flares in firefights is quite\\nstupid since the damage of the unseen bullets are not really visible\\naside from what the makeup depicted. It's great to see that many alumni\\nof this movie grew into big names such as Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen,\\nWillem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, and even Johnny Depp. Most of them acted\\nout really nice performances in this movie.\\n\",\n",

He makes sure you know that only the lower classes fought, that\\nany given platoon was filled with murderous sadists, that everyone\\nsmoked weed and drank, and that almost no one believed in the cause,\\nexcept the one evil guy. Also remember that this is a movie starring\\nCharlie Sheen, narrating what it\\'s like to be in the jungles of\\nVietnam. Does that remind you of something? Yes, his dad already did\\nthat in Apocalypse Now, 7 years earlier. So that draws away from the\\noriginality of this one. But I did like the central conflict of a nice\\nSergeant versus a barbaric, yet effective one. Both were brave and\\neffective soldiers, employing very different tactics. Before I get to\\nthe repeated sadism, let me remind everyone that the war was not just\\nabout some lower class American guys shooting up some local Asian\\npeasants in funny hats. America was fighting the superpowers of China\\nand the U.S.S.R., who were backing the North Vietnamese, and who had\\ndesigns on world domination. Also remember that Communism murdered\\nmillions upon millions of people, including Cambodians, once the\\nAmericans went home. I think the movie did do a decent job of showing\\nyou the dialog and daily mannerisms of low class men, when left alone.\\nIn most cases, whomever you were back home, will still be with you in\\nthe jungle. If you were the type of guy who shirked responsibility or\\nblamed others for your mistakes, or you were self-indulgent, or lazy,\\netc., you will be that at war too. Interestingly there is only one\\nChristian depicted, and that is a quiet Hispanic Catholic soldier who\\nnever speaks. I would think that in real life, even many uneducated,\\nsmall town soldiers would still be Christians. The two Sergeants were\\ntoo old to be draftees. So they were career military. But they act like\\ncommon soldiers. Even though Sergeants are not officially \"Officers,\" a\\ncareer soldier might be more conservative that the way these guys were\\nportrayed. I\\'ll grant the fact that Stone was apparently a soldier\\nthere himself, and I was not. I don\\'t doubt that some of the clich\\xe9s\\nyou see in these movies are true. But they just tend to be one-sided.\\nTom Berenger was excellent, as was Willem Dafoe. Despite what a weird\\nguy Sheen wound up becoming in real life, I have to say that I like him\\nin those 80s movies. There was something very natural about his acting.\\nI don\\'t think Johnny Depp even spoke in this one, and Kevin Dillon\\nplayed the same kind of guy he would wind up playing for the next\\nquarter century. The gung-ho dumb-dumb. Music was not employed with the\\nsame degree of effectiveness in this one, as it was in Apocalypse Now.\\nToo violent for me, but I did like the way the picture showed the daily\\nfrustrations of lack of sleep, leeches, personality conflicts, and\\nfear.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nIn my eyes the best film Oliver Stone ever made, Platoon mirrors his\\nown experiences as a GI serving time in Vietnam.The story is told from the point of view of runt Chris Taylor, an\\neducated boy who volunteers to serve in the war, who discovers that\\npatrolling the jungles around Cambodia not only drastically raises the\\nmortality rate, it renders him completely worthless in the eyes of\\nthose who've served any amount of time longer than he has.Quickly outliving his fellow runts, Taylor sees a line in the sand\\ndrawn between the laid back and sympathetic Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe in\\na very emotionally memorable role) and his pot smoking troops and the\\nhard-edged Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger in an equally powerful but darker\\nrole) and his beer and whiskey drinking ass-kickers. He immediately\\nchooses to side with Elias' squad, just wanting to make it through the\\nwar with his mind in tact but that hope doesn't last so long as the\\ndeeper into the jungle they roam, and the more horrors they witness,\\nthe powers that be and their backers become corrupted by hatred towards\\nthe Vietnamese and one another.Soon enough, the conflict rages out of control and when the enemy\\nlaunches a massive offensive, the platoon is barely able to fight their\\nway out after communication between them has completely broken down.Platoon boasts possibly the largest number of relatively fresh stars\\nlaunched into movie stardom and legend status for any film in history\\nalthough there were some familiar faces that had featured in successful\\ntitles some years before such as Keith David (The Thing) and Tom\\nBerenger (Dogs of War). Other names include Charlie Sheen (Two And A\\nHalf Men), Forest Whittaker (Phenomenon), Tony Todd (Candyman), Kevin\\nDillon (Entourage), John C. McGinley (Scrubs), Johnny Depp (who???) and\\nthe list goes on.'Platoon' boasts a massive multi-strand narrative telling not only the\\nstory of the war and the overbearing in-fighting between Elias and\\nBarnes, but also the individual stories of soldiers destined to either\\ngo home or just fill another black rubber bag. It's touching even to\\nsee someone we don't like very much spouting obscenities like a broken\\nrecord player one moment and then their bloody lifeless body being\\nthrown on the pile the next moment and that imagery sums up the war for\\nso many people; kids just working themselves into bad habits, watching\\ntheir best friends die and knowing deep down that they are going to die\\ntoo. It makes every tiny little indiscretion worth fighting for and\\nthat's why they all end up jumping at each others' throats, acting more\\nlike a lynch-mob than a platoon.It also boasts the most organic scenery ever used in a film of its kind\\nand, of course, the now legendary 'Adagio For Strings' theme by Samuel\\nBarber, which was made so memorable in its many scenes imprinted on the\\nimpressionable human mind.The perfect mix of drama and action, comedy and tragedy, feel-good\\nfactor and depression any war film could hope for, Platoon reaches a\\nconclusion that not only hits you like a bullet between the eyes, it\\nleaves you wondering what happened to all those left behind, the ones\\nthat survived up until the final credits!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThe best and most accurate movie made about the Vietnam War before the\\nTet Offensive of 1967-68. SHOT IN THE PHILIPPINES IN 1986?Impossible but... as a proud Filipino I would never have believe that\\nOliver Stone, a Vietnam veteran in the US Army and then in his upstart\\nas a full tine film director, would choose the great lands of the\\nPhilippines and our great actors and actresses for this film to be shot\\nin 1986, his second in a list of great works and the first in his\\nVietnam film series.Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Forest Whitaker, Johnny\\nDepp, Dale Dye and others would have loved our lush landscape and our\\ngenerous and warm welcomed people when they were here to film Platoon.\\nI would have been proud of them 25 years on... but it's still the best.\\nShows a great portrayal of the war in the eyes of US Army soldiers who\\nexperienced the troubles and trials of fighting there.After all these years, I'll still gonna call it the best. As it was\\nshot in the Philippines, most especially in the provinces of Cavite and\\nLaguna, I'll gonna say it's a great Vietnam War movie to watch. Truly,\\nI think of all the fallen and the veterans of this war whenever I watch\\nit. The Philippines had only sent military personnel there for relief\\nduties, but of all the countries involved both Vietnams and the US bore\\nmost of the combat losses of the war, and so many veterans suffered so\\nmuch like Sheen here in the film. I'll always remember them.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n-I cannot stop watching this movie. Taylor(Charlie Sheen) is narrative\\nin a way. One thing I remember is Taylor's fear of snakes. But he got\\nover that very soon. Another thing I remember is that he wrote to his\\ngrandmother. He did not write to his mother and father, and that was\\nbecause his parents did not want him to go..The least savory, or one of\\nthe least, was Junior, who almost got Taylor killed, and a lot others.\\nI am pretty old now, yet I was too young for the draft, or Vietnam. I\\nsaw Apocalypse Now in my small town, and it blew my mind. . In Platoon,\\nthe mainstay of the military movements was to find the bunkers of the\\nNVA. Taylor's commander was a Sergeant named Barnes, a rugged veteran\\nwho took it up himself to command the platoon. He was rough around the\\nedges, maybe a little too. Elias was in the soft parade, or it seemed\\nthat way. He was not benevolent, that was not the right word. He cared\\nabout the soldiers a lot, and was willing to do anything for the\\ntroops.Back at the canteen the soldiers were partying a lot, and Taylor had\\nhis first exposure to that kind of thing. But everybody loved him and\\nthought a lot of him, until something happened that changed his whole\\nperception of the infantry. Really, it was a lot of things that made\\nhim feel different, and that was when the platoon ran across a group of\\nNVA. Taylor began to see the war in a whole new light. He felt that\\nthere were not any rules out in the bush.. An excellent movie. Every\\ntime I see it I see something different. My opinion of the film is that\\nKeith David deserved a nomination. If for no other reason, I think so\\nbecause of his attitude as a soldier and infantryman.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThat\\'s the title card to Oliver Stone\\'s 1986 Vietnam War masterpiece\\n\"Platoon\", but you\\'re not going to see much rejoicing in this film\\n\\'cause it identifies the Vietnam infantry experience as no less than\\nhell on earth.THE PLOT: Chris Taylor naively volunteers for combat in Vietnam (late\\n\\'67 through \\'68) and slowly adapts to the jungle warfare and becomes an\\nadequate grunt. A rift eventually develops between the senior sergeant,\\nBarnes (Tom Berenger), and the junior sergeant, Elias (Willem Dafoe);\\nthe former a veritable indestructible killing machine and the latter an\\nexpert soldier who refuses to allow the horrors of war to rob him of\\nhis humanity.\"Platoon\" is masterful movie-making in practically every way and towers\\nover most other Vietnam war flicks, with the sole exception of\\n\"Apocalypse Now\" (the original version). What works best is the\\nensemble cast and the numerous memorable characters who all smack of\\nreal life -- Taylor, Barnes, Elias, Lt. Wolfe, O\\'Neill, Bunny, Junior,\\nKing, Rhah, Crawford, Tex and Big Harold (amongst others). The idea\\nthat any filmmaker can effectively bring to life a dozen or more\\ncharacters like this in a 2-hour film is uncanny to say the least.Memorable moments abound, including: - After stumbling upon a just-abandoned Vietcong nest where a soldier\\ncomes up missing, the platoon finds his corpse staked-up down the river\\nand the camera slowly pans across the visage of practically every\\nplatoon member culminating with Barnes, who mutters with seething\\nvengeance. This is a potent scene spotlighting a band of American\\nwarriors, from very diverse racial/ethnic/socio-economic backgrounds,\\nforced together halfway around the world in some God-forsaken jungle to\\nface an enemy of jungle wraiths.- After the Barnes/Elias fight at the village Barnes is informed by\\nCaptain Harris that there will be a full investigation. Barnes leaves\\nthe meeting and walks by his two disciples O\\'Niell and Bunny. O\\'Neill\\nasks Barnes if there\\'s going to be an investigation. The laconic Barnes\\nstops but doesn\\'t answer; he just looks away, as if in thought, smoking\\nhis cigarette. The camera stays on Barnes while Bunny responds:\\n\"O\\'Neill, man, you worry to much; the sergeant will take care of him.\"\\nLooking at Barnes\\' countenance you just KNOW he\\'s contemplating murder.\\nThe scene is filmmaking of the highest order.- In a dugout six of the soldiers who sided with Elias discuss what to\\ndo after it appears Elias had been shot by Barnes in combat. They all\\nwant to kill the scarred-face Barnes, but Rhah reveals Barnes\\' stature\\nwith the men is nigh mythological at this point; he\\'s been hit seven\\ntimes and still isn\\'t dead. \"Barnes ain\\'t meant to die! The only thing\\nthat can kill Barnes is Barnes\". A shirtless Barnes suddenly appears,\\ndrinking a bottle of whiskey; apparently he heard the whole\\nconversation. He boldly confronts all six with a fascinating rant (\"I\\nam reality\") and challenges them to kill him. None of them take the\\nbait because they deem him a human tiger, except Taylor, who\\'s no match\\nfor Barnes in man-to-man combat. Although Barnes is the villain in the\\nfilm you can\\'t help but admire his sheer boldness and killer skills;\\nit\\'s clear why the men respect and fear him.By contrast, Elias is the compassionate, loving and righteous\\nChrist-figure. If there\\'s any doubt to this it\\'s bludgeoned into the\\nviewer via the melodramatic and unrealistic death scene, which can be\\n(slightly) excused on the grounds of its iconic imagery (the cover of\\nthe DVD) and obvious symbolism. This scene is the only reason I rate\\nthe film 9/10 rather than 10/10.Bunny (Kevin Dillon) is an interesting character. He\\'s young, simple\\nand likable but the war morphs him into a nigh-psychotic killer, so\\nmuch so that he seriously creeps the other men out. But, again, he\\nsomehow maintains an amiable charm, unlike Tex who comes across wholly\\nvenomous.Some have criticized that it\\'s impossible to make a war film that\\'s\\nanti-war on the grounds that war films by their nature make war seem\\nfun in an adventurous way. Not so with \"Platoon\". How did Stone\\naccomplish this? Well, aside from skillfully showing the hard\\nday-to-day life of infantry men in the jungle, the combat scenes are\\nviewed from the grunt\\'s disoriented perspective where, often, there are\\nno clear battle lines of good guys/bad guys (even within the platoon\\nitself!); the enemy -- ghostly figures who are never clearly seen --\\ncan come from any angle. Anything can and does happen, at anytime.\\nStone denies the viewer the feeling that this type of jungle combat\\nmakes sense. Needless to ask, how can anyone go through such without\\nbeing inwardly scarred for life? Some criticize the flagrant cussing\\nbut Stone was shooting for realism; I know from experience that this is\\ngenerally how grunts talk. I don\\'t know about you but, if I\\'m going to\\nsee a war film, I want to see the awful truth, not some cleaned-up\\nfantasy BS.The ending shows that Barnes & Elias are figurative of flesh & spirit,\\nthe conflicting forces within us all. (SPOILER) Taylor reflects, \"The\\nwar is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my\\ndays, as I\\'m sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah\\ncalled \\'possession of my soul\\'. There are times since I\\'ve felt like a\\nchild, born of those two fathers. But, be that as it may, those of us\\nwho did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others\\nwhat we know, and to try with what\\'s left of our lives to find a\\ngoodness and a meaning to this life.\" Amen.GRADE: A\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nIt\\'s both invoking in the plot, but more engaging with its uniquely\\nbelievable characters. Oliver stone directs a master piece of both\\nmodern, and psychological warfare, embarking on a quest where its\\nfocused soldiers must an enemy far greater than the gooks, themselves.\\nIt\\'s very strange that when we fight a known enemy any actions, no\\nmatter how cruel or vile, they seem normal. However when we fight\\namongst ourselves, all goes to hell. In the time of the film, our\\napparent hero Chris Taylor (Sheen) narrates both his feelings, his\\nclarifications, as well as his doubts on the subject of the war. As\\nTaylor walks us through his own experience of the Hell that once made\\ngo into an infinite panic, we all get brief but accurate glimpses of\\nthe true Vietnam. If many people believed that being a soldier back\\nthen was a proud honor, no matter what unit, or what position they were\\nplaced in, then they were dead wrong. It was nothing more and nothing\\nless. The grunts were able to take it , on the account that they were\\nnothing before they had the military. It\\'s quite graphic and yet\\nenjoyable to watch as Oliver Stone digs deep into what many soldiers\\nwere like back then. Vietnam was a very difficult time, not just for\\nthis country, but for the very men fighting in it. In their gaze of\\nthat very Hell they resorted to drug use out of a necessity to escape\\nthat endless cold reality of death, and what struck me as intrigued was\\njust how believable the characters were. They all felt screwed over in\\nwhatever way the war ,or the military had done to them. Some used their\\nown moral compass to make actions any sane human would easily hesitate\\nto make. The very performance by Tom Beranger as Sgt. Barnes was\\nincredible, as he represented a soldier who has had his good time in\\nVietnam well enough to see how and what he can do. He gazes on the very\\npot heads he commands, saying he is reality, only to have viewers\\nassume that he feels no repent for his less than prominent actions.\\nSgt. Allias (Daffoe) is portrayed as the more rational soldier, whom\\nlike Barnes understands the nature of how much insanity defines the\\nvery war they are fighting, while still maintaining his own dignity as\\na human being and not a murderer with authority. Its very clear that\\nthe established rivalry among these two Sergeants divides soldiers into\\ntwo different sides, making the Gooks the least of their problems.\\nBasically the film portrays Vietnam as general Vietnam. Early 5 a.m.\\nwake up, daily digging and humping, and all night watches through dark\\ninfested Jungles. It\\'s all very clear at just how little the gooks were\\nas the enemy, for the true battle was between themselves. As Taylor\\'s\\ncharacter goes through more improved developments, responding more\\ncommonly to the very site of war, everything becomes more clear to him.\\nThat very knowledge has given him the assurance that he can use what he\\nlearned in his experience as guidance, knowing he will never be the\\nsame again. Taylor came to Vietnam as a college dropout with very\\nlittle Ambition, and he came out with more than an experience, but a\\nforever lasting mark of the true nature of war. \"Platoon\" is a riveting\\nwar drama, combining a brilliant form of direction as Oliver Stone\\nmaintains focus on the elements of the Vietnam war, out of respect for\\nthose who died, and delivers characters that are very common and yet\\nvery unique by the personalities that define them. \"Platoon\" gives\\nviewers a deeper look into what goes on inside the platoon, rather than\\nwhat is outside it.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon is just another war film or its something else.Yes,it is just\\nnot another war film.Seems like a war film with strong undercurrents\\nquestioning man moments of honesty and his will to do good.Oliver Stone\\ngives us Vietnams Vengeance on the morality of U.S army officers.The\\nmovie shows how U.S war soldiers hated Vietnam and hence in their anger\\nand fury started hating each other.Charlie Sheen performance is\\ncommendable as he is the one who is haunted by the questions of good\\nand evil in the jungles of Vietnam.But the movie describes the inner\\nself of two men.Elias as William Defoe and Barnes as Tom Berenger.Both\\nare warriors and both are haunted by war.Both have their own ways of\\nsurviving and satisfaction.Barnes turns to bad killing innocents\\nwhereas Elias finds satisfaction in taking of drugs and always helping\\nothers.The movie also has some famous actors like Johnny Depp and\\nForest Whitetaker when they were not famous.Some scenes like Elias\\nrunning from Vietnamese and crying for help to his friends are\\namazing.The soundtrack of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings will\\nsurely leave you numb.War scenes are well carried out and character\\ndisplay is perfect.Oliver Stone here gives a film that leaves you numb\\nand all think that war could turn all good to evil.Charlie Sheen ending\\nlines are captivating and echoing.Platoon talks about hatred for\\nVietnam,love for home,innocence of youth and last but not the least\\nmorality of men who usually get consumed and lost in the war.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nChris Taylor is a young, naive American who gives up college and\\nvolunteers for combat in Vietnam. Upon arrival, he quickly discovers\\nthat his presence is quite nonessential, and is considered\\ninsignificant to the other soldiers, as he has not fought for as long\\nas the rest of them and felt the effects of combat. Chris has two\\ncommanding officers, the ill-tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant\\nRobert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias\\nGrodin. A line is drawn between the two officers and a number of men in\\nthe platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid. As\\nthe war continues, Chris himself draws towards psychological\\nmeltdown... Oliver Stone\\'s Platoon is an epic film that depicts the\\nVietnam War and the horrific things that some men did and witnessed, it\\nalso shows the insanity of war, the terrible conditions the soldiers\\nfought under, and perhaps more importantly, the psychological element\\nthat wore down so many men. Stone used some of his own experiences of\\nbeing in Vietnam to write this story and the result is what seems to be\\na very authentic and realistic film. It\\'s a gritty and emotional look\\nat this terrible conflict, mostly seen through the perspective of the\\nyoung recruit Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). The main storyline and\\npossible the most interesting aspect of the film is the realization by\\nTaylor, that he is fighting two battles, the conflict with the enemy\\nand the conflict between the men within his platoon. In terms of the\\nstory I thought it was terrific and it feels/looks authentic, however,\\nwith the exception of Sheen, the acting was a bit over the top and\\nquite a distraction. The musical score is very effective with the\\n\"Adagio for Strings\" composition really bringing all the emotion out of\\nthe scenes. In conclusion, Platoon is a great war film, it might be\\ndisturbing but it\\'s also necessary. On a side note, I watched a version\\nwith not so great quality, so I might enjoy the film a little more upon\\na second viewing.7.5/10\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nWar is hell, but for fans of Oliver Stone\\'s tribute to the foot\\nsoldiers of the Vietnam War, this Sony Pictures Home Entertainment\\nUltimate Edition DVD (2006) is sheer Hanoi Heaven. Platoon: The Special\\nEdition was originally released in 2001 - so what else is new? And is\\nit worth flogging your old one on eBay to make room for this little war\\nbaby? The resounding answer comes with all the force of a purple-faced\\ndrill sergeant screaming suggestive remarks about one\\'s sister in your\\nface. That\\'s a yes, then. Yes what? Yes Sir.The extras, including TV spots, photo galleries and trailers, are\\nlegion - but the selling point here (aside from a cleaned-up DTS\\nSurround Sound) are two new featurettes: at nearly one-hour long, \\'Tour\\nOf The Inferno\\' is a superb making of film directed by Charles\\nKiselyak, who also directed the marvellous One Flew Over The Cuckoo\\'s\\nNest documentary \\'Completely Cuckoo\\'. \\'Tour...\\' begins with the young\\nStone \"entertaining ideas of suicide\", until Vietnam offered him an\\nescape route; and Oliver was ravenous for it. His resulting screenplay\\nmay have authentically captured the first-hand experience of in-country\\ncombat but, as producer Arnold Kopelson notes, the script was initially\\nrejected out of hand by almost everybody.We then trace the movie from pre-production on, relating how the actors\\nspent two weeks at boot camp in the Philippines under the rigorous,\\nregimented auspices of military adviser Captain Dale Dye of the US\\nMarine Corps (retired), who\\'d spent three months in Vietnam, \"almost\\nall that time on the line\".Willem Dafoe recalls contracting jungle fever while Johnny Depp\\nremembers eating something called \"bean component\" for dinner. (\"I\\'d\\nrather have eaten my own socks.\"). Stone and Dyer\\'s commitment to\\nrealism ensured production was equally fraught for the virgin soldiers,\\nwho remember Stone bullying, cursing and generally hounding them as far\\nas they could physically and psychologically go.Meanwhile, the short featurette \\'Preparation For The Nam\\' describes the\\nreality of training from the veteran\\'s perspective. (\"It was hard to\\nsit and listen to some of those sergeants try and lecture, coz they\\nwere terrible speakers.\") Stone, who arrived for his own tour of duty\\nin 1967 on his 21st birthday, provides an intensely personal audio\\ncommentary, reeling off his experiences in synch with the action, and\\nat times identifying so closely with Sheen that the film and his\\nvoice-over resembles the second-by-second memoir-cum-confession that,\\nfor all intents, it is. \"There\\'s my command sergeant... a fat drunk.\"\\nHe\\'s re-living it all over again, and it makes for compelling\\nlistening. \"These boys returned old and fractured souls\", says Stone.\\n\"Part of them was dead forever.\" And his near-monosyllabic voice-over\\nis most effective when describing the horrors he\\'s seen and carried\\nout; alternately \"making friends and jokes with North Vietnamese\\nvillagers - and killing them.\" For first-person insight, it\\'s also hard to beat Dye\\'s audio\\ncommentary. Part Rambo, part drama teacher, Dye describes how he kept\\nthe actors in character throughout - and Tom Berenger in particular\\n(\"He would have made a damn fine platoon sergeant.\") Dye recalls\\ncutting the cast\\'s \"Hollywood hair off - something I enjoyed\\nimmensely\", and, \"using what I call field experience\", jumped in that\\nbodybag himself in the opening sequence to add verisimilitude.According to Captain Dye, he and Oliver had differences of opinion over\\nStone\\'s approach to directing - \"me screaming and yelling and calling\\nhim \\'Ho Chi Minh\\' and Oliver calling me \\'John Wayne\\'\". And it\\'s\\ncertainly disquieting to hear him describe the climactic bloodbath as\\n\"beautiful, man. Hear that sound? That\\'s a bayonet in the chest. We\\nactually did that by stabbing a watermelon. With a bayonet.\" But to return to the real reason we\\'re here, and the reason Platoon was\\nwritten: catharsis. \\'One War, Many Stories\\' finds a roomful of veterans\\ntreated to a special screening-cum-gestalt therapy, moderated by one Dr\\nJames Lull (formerly Army 1st Cavalry Division 1963-1966). Dr Lull\\ninvites the vets to use the opportunity to express their feelings and\\nrecollections about Vietnam, prompted by what they\\'ve just seen. Bill\\nHutton (USMC Battalion 4th Marines) recalls \"the uncommon courage of\\nsome of the people I saw\"; while Odas Flake (Charlie Company 1965-1966)\\njust thanks God he served when he did, \"when it was a true war, with\\ngood leaders - there was no smoking dope in the tents or in the bush\".Well, mea culpa interjects Paul Gold (Army 1st Cavalry 1965-1968), \"I\\nwas one of the guys who was smoking dope and was using heroin, and I\\nremember getting a whipping from a bunch of Southern white guys coz I\\nhung out with the black guys - they had the parties and the drugs.\"\\nSoon, the screening room is filled with animated conversation,\\nsoul-searching, a few tears - and healing laughter. There may be an\\nuntapped vortex of howling pain present, but these guys are mostly\\nkeeping it together; if there\\'s a Travis Bickle among them, he\\'s\\nprobably curled in a foetal position under his chair, softly banging\\nhis head on the carpet and weeping soundlessly. As Stone, with \"the\\nsoul of a murderer\" soberly states, \"It\\'s better to talk. That\\'s the\\nway to heal.\"\\n',\n",

While very violent, it's the\\npsychological and emotional scars of war that are shown here. Two\\nsergeants, one a compassionate disillusioned Elias who helps rookies\\ngrow accustomed to the war, and sergeant Barnes who ruthless and would\\nkill a child to find information. They butt heads morally throughout\\nthe film and the war has given Barnes both physical scars and\\npsychological scars. Watch this movie and you will love this story.Acting: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, and Charlie Sheen give the\\nperformances of their careers with these films. Charlie Sheen makes a\\nvery sympathetic narrator who tells the story through letters to his\\ngrandmother and is basically in the center of the conflict between the\\ntwo sergeants. Dafoe creates a sergeant who you would love to be\\nfriends with as he cares about everyone. He basically represents Christ\\nthroughout the film. Berenger creates probably the second (second to\\nMarlon Brando in Apocalypse Now) scariest military man I've ever seen\\nin a war film. He is so effective that despite having some sympathy for\\nhow the war has twisted someone who may have once been a good man, you\\nstill have resentment and horror at some of his actions. All of the\\nactors fulfill their part as well. Some are compassionate and some are\\nas ruthless as Barnes. This was definitely one of the best casts I've\\nseen in a war film.Visual/Audio: The jungles they used for this movie really gives the\\nfeel that they are in Vietnam. They create confusion in order to\\nenhance that feel. The music heard at times also makes you feel like\\nit's the 60s. The battles are set up very well to show the carnage but\\nalso to make you sort of confused to give you that feeling that many\\nsoldiers had. The jungles are both frightening and beautiful to look\\nat.Overall this is in my opinion the greatest war film ever made. Or\\nanti-war film. Stone tries to paint the war very negatively and tries\\nto show how horrible its effects on people were physical or\\npsychological. SEE THIS MOVIE! 10/10\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nIn 1986, Vietnam veteran-turned-filmmaker Oliver Stone directed\\n\"Platoon\", a film that went on to score four wins at the Academy\\nAwards, including one for Stone himself. And it is easy to see why a\\nfilm such as \"Platoon\" could not only accomplish that but also go on to\\nbe considered one of the best motion pictures of all time. It is a\\ngritty, horrifying, profanity-filled (but in a recommendable way)\\nportrait of the unjustifiable Vietnam War and will continue to live on\\nin the memories of audience members for ages to come.\"Platoon\" stars Charlie Sheen in what I think is one of his better\\nperformances (it is nice to see a gifted actor like Sheen occasionally\\nstepping away from the dull low-budget comedies he and others like him\\nare often associated with) as Chris, a young recruit who enlists to\\nfight in the Vietnam War, only to find in his experiences it was all a\\nhorrible mistake. He becomes part of a platoon of soldiers who are\\ndivided between their two sergeants, a violent fighter named Barnes\\n(Tom Berenger) and the more calm and patient Elias (Willem Dafoe).\\nChris soon discovers that as a newcomer, he is not expected to live\\nvery long through the war and as time marches on and killing after\\nkilling passes, he begins to believe it too.Aside from Sheen, Berenger, and Dafoe (the last two received Academy\\nAward nominations for their performances in this film) the film stars\\nForrest Whittaker, Francesco Quinn, and a very young Johnny Depp among\\nother gifted actors. They portray characters who are so wonderfully\\nmodeled by Oliver Stone\\'s screenplay and so well fitted into this\\nhorrible wartime setting that from start to finish, it is nearly\\nimpossible for the audience to decipher which characters are going to\\nbe killed off and which, if any, are not. This enhances the atmosphere\\nof the film and makes it seem more like a true story rather than just a\\nmotion picture detailing a fictional chapter of a real-life conflict.There is a lot of profanity in \"Platoon\" that many viewers will find so\\nmuch as to even describe the film as anti-American. There is excessive\\nswearing, drugs, a rape scene, and a lot of gritty violence used in\\nStone\\'s vision to capture the war that he experienced. But I don\\'t see\\nthe profanity as part of an anti-American film, I see it as elements of\\na true work of art and in its own strange way, it works. In other films\\nthat use the same profanity (Predator 2 for instance) it becomes\\noffensive, but here it adheres to the allegorical point. And the\\naddition of Samuel Barber\\'s classic music composition \"Adagio for\\nStrings\" works out very well in the dramatic, tear-jerking moments.Oliver Stone\\'s \"Platoon\" is a masterwork of the fabulous art of motion\\npictures and I am very thankful to see that it is ranked as one of the\\nbest war pictures not just by critics, but audience members as well. It\\nis a thrilling, well-acted film that in some scenes, especially the\\ndeath of a character whom I will not reveal, even succeeded in bringing\\ntears to my eyes.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe theme is the same as Apocalypse -- the tenuous existence of justice\\nin war. But the treatment is very different. Where Apocalypse was about\\nthe insanity of war, this is about the pathos and the beauty of it.\\nBoth involve thoughtful men (and both Sheens) who journey through war\\'s\\nlandscape and come out alive on the other end, transformed. Charlie\\ndevelops wisdom and pathos. Martin\\'s transformation is from one type of\\ndysfunction to another. My gut tells me the latter is truer to life,\\nbut then again Stone is real veteran.Elias is Christ. \"He\\'s a water walker,\" \"he thinks he\\'s Jesus F-ckin\\nChrist,\" his arms are outstretched as he dies for everyone else\\'s sins.\\nBarnes is his antithesis, the machine of war. He\\'s (nearly) invincible,\\nwith an independent justice, but a system nonetheless. The ultimate\\nmessage is that the purveyor of these two is a spineless bureaucrat\\nfrom officer training. But war isn\\'t a morality play. Good and evil are relative, there is no\\nstandard coordinate plane from which to judge right and wrong. Oliver\\nStone knows this, but he still gives us the simplistic treatment.\\nApocalypse makes no mention at all of good or evil, just the diseased\\nsystem and everyone\\'s roles in it. Kind of a David Simon world, but\\nrotting. I prefer that version. This one evokes the same tender emotion\\nthat Barber\\'s music does -- beauty in a tragic world.

       " u'\\n\"Platoon\", simply put, is one of the best movies I have ever had the\\nprivilege of seeing. Besides the incredible performances of Charlie\\nSheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, the music sets the perfect mood.\\nThe cinematography and directing are superb, and as you watch the\\ntransformation of Sheen\\'s character, from a doe eyed, naive young\\nsoldier to an animal. His metamorphisis is astounding, as you watch the\\ninnocence washed from his face, replacing it with blood. Perhaps the\\nmost interesting part of this movie is that the major part of the war\\nisn\\'t between the vietnamese and the Americans; it\\'s the Americans\\nagainst themselves. Tom berenger is perfect in his character. The hate\\nyou build for him is incredible, and by the end of the movie, you want\\nSheen to kill him. You don\\'t want the court system to take Berenger to\\njustice, you want to see him shot, and die in the Vietnam jungle.Oliver stone delivers one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments\\never captured on film. Simply put, it\\'s one of the most powerful,\\nthought provoking films ever made.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nMost will find this ultra realistic Vietnam war story a difficult film\\nto watch, especially those who lived through that era. I had put off\\nseeing this all these years since I was afraid of the memories it would\\nbring back, and I was never even in the service. One of the few\\nstatements that Dick Cheney has made that I identify with is, \"I had\\nother priorities in the \\'60s than military service.\" Truth be told\\nstaying out of Vietnam was a priority of mine, as well as most of my\\nfriends - the specter of the draft was always there. Student deferments\\nwere the method of choice for accomplishing avoidance for a lot of\\nkids. But then in 1969 came the draft lottery - every day of the year\\nwas assigned a number and the lower your number the more exposed you\\nwere to being drafted. The lottery was televised and I remember sitting\\nin a large room with about sixty guys and hearing the groans as the low\\nnumbers were drawn out of the hopper. This was truly a surreal\\nexperience, a mild version of Russian roulette. Many of those with low\\nnumbers opted for the method of last resort - flight to Canada. I offer\\nthis memory as but one that this film triggered. Almost everyone who\\nlived through the Vietnam war era was scarred by it - few got off\\nscott-free, including of course the countries involved (estimated U.S.\\ndeaths 58,000, with 300,000 wounded; estimated Vietnam deaths in excess\\nof one million). The wounds are still healing.The most acute memories this movie brought back were recollections of\\nthe clips on the nightly news which indeed had the same feel as this\\nmovie. Oliver Stone\\'s having served in Vietnam lends credence to this\\nharrowing tale; you have to assume that it is to no small extent\\nautobiographical.The satire of \"Tropic Thunder\" notwithstanding, no matter the the\\nbackstage antics, judgment should be rendered on the quality of the\\nfinal product. And \"Platoon\" ranks high on that scale. The performances\\nare uniformly good, presenting us with an ensemble of believable\\ncharacters.The real quality of the film lies in its focus on how the soldiers\\ndealt with the constant backdrop of anxiety, chaos, and fear. This is\\ncaptured so well that those emotions are transmitted to the viewer,\\nalbeit at what is probably a one per cent level of what the actual\\nsoldiers experienced, but enough to cause troubled sleep. There are no\\nbattle charts or high level officers discussing strategy here, just\\nwhat the men in this platoon were facing on a daily basis. One of the\\nvalues of the film is that it dispels much of the mystery as to how\\nsome of the horrendous things that were reported at the time (like\\ncivilians being killed, villages burned, officers fragged) could\\nhappen. And you see why using any drugs to get you through the day made\\nperfect sense. It makes you a lot more hesitant to pass judgment on the\\nactions of soldiers while sitting in the comfort of your home.I think this is the least political of Stone\\'s films. There seems to be\\na desire just to \"tell it like it was.\" The political back-story never\\nenters into the picture. There were not many people who served in\\nVietnam with the intelligence and movie-making skills of Stone and it\\nis good that he has given us this film as one portal to understanding\\nwhat happened on the ground in Vietnam.I have always been curious as to whether I would have lasted ten\\nminutes or five on the ground in Vietnam. Seeing this movie indicates\\nto me that the latter is probably the case.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon is as close to Vietnam as you can get. And no, I'm not talking\\nabout combat or any of that, however, I'm talking about the sweat,\\nheat, frustration, exhaustion, and emotional horrors of war. I often\\nwatch this movie about once every four to five days.As Tom Berenger being one of my favorite actors, he, as Staff Sgt.\\nBarnes is my favorite character. I know it's hard to like him, but I\\ndon't like him for being savage, ruthless or brutal. I like him because\\nhis character shows what war can turn a man into.Platoon is overall a masterful film about war. As I said before, I\\nwatch this film on a regular basis, and I have done so for years. Every\\ntime I watch, I am touched, and enjoy every minute of it.Overall, with 3 astounding performances by the great Tom Berenger,\\nWillem Dafoe, and Charlie Sheen, Platoon is an absolute wonder of a\\nfilm. Once again, I must tell you how much I love Staff Sgt. Barnes.\\nHardassism is what Staff Sgt. Barnes defines, and it is what Barnes\\nsurvived by. Amazing.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThis is one of the two best Vietnam movies ever made, alongside\\napocalypse now. Oliver Stone has proved many times, how excellent he is\\nat making films. This movie is extremely powerful, dramatic, sad and\\nsuspenseful. Worth watching for anyone who enjoys war movies or mostly\\nany movies. Platoon explores the action of the Vietnam war (the shooting and\\nfighting) and shows the (sometimes even more horrible) side of the war,\\nthe way it effects the soldiers. There are many, many scenes in this\\nmovie that could draw a tear from ANYONE, this movie is utterly\\nbrilliant!Charlie Sheen plays the \"new guy\" volunteering to fight for America in\\nVietnam. He makes friends, enemies and troubles. His two commanding\\nofficers (Bessenger and Deffoe) have a grudge against each other. Sheen\\ndecides to take the side of Deffoe. Whether that\\'s good or bad, you\\nshall find out. This movie shows the sides of the war that make the\\nsoldiers go insane, crazy, addicted to drugs, suicidal and homicidal.No fault... 11/10\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThis movie was very confusing at first. I watched it in school and\\ndidn't really get what was going on too much. Then again, I was IN\\nSCHOOL. So I watched, thought it was OK, then moved on with my life.\\nHowever, soon I started to want to see this movie again for seemingly\\nno reason. I was compelled to watch Platoon again at home...and so I\\ndid. Let me just tell you, it was 1000x better than at school. The movie starts off simple enough, a new soldier from a middle class\\nexistence arrives in Vietnam, not knowing what he has in store. Soon\\nafter, the movie shows its true colors...Charlie Sheen was terrific as the curious new recruit, Pvt. Chris\\nTaylor. Sheen has a habit of either being in really good or really bad\\nmovies. This happens to be a really good movie. Possibly his best.Tom Berenger was excellent as the antagonizing, shady, mysterious,\\ntough Sgt. Bob BarnesWillem Dafoe was also great as the sneaky, helpful, rebellious Sgt.\\nElias.There were many other excellent performances but if I took the time to\\nsummarize each one of them, the comment would take up about 2-3 pages.\\nBUT, I can say that most of the actors here were just starting off in\\ntheir careers or are no-name actors, but they deliver MUCH more than\\nwas expected of them. For many, this was their best film. Oliver Stone did a perfect job telling the story of his time in\\nVietnam, and showing things how he saw them. The war was a cold,\\ndemeaning place to him so that is how he portrayed it. With the\\nexception of about 5 characters, everyone was mean, rude, heartless,\\nand a bully. Particularly Bunny (Kevin Dillon). However, EVERYONE\\nincluding the nice people were somewhat out of their minds, which is\\nwhat seems to be closest to fact about the Vietnam conflict.I truly enjoyed this movie. It was realistic yet fictional, and the 2\\nelements worked together well. Chris was well portrayed and showed us\\nthe ins and outs, ups and downs of Vietnam. If you're looking for a\\nrealistic, good movie, this is the one for you. I wouldn't say this\\nmovie is for the weak-minded or light-hearted, but if you're up to it,\\ncheck it out. 10/10.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nDon\\'t let any thing anyone says about this film fool you for Platoon\\nhas broken my top 50 and has very quickly etched its way into my list I\\nhave at the back of my mind detailing my favourite films in the war\\ngenre. A conclusion I came to when watching Platoon and something that\\nis echoed during new recruit Chris Taylor (Sheen) in one of his\\nvoiceovers is that the real enemy is indeed the one from within your\\nown side; the conflict that is going on within a band of people all\\nattempting to prove how macho each other can be over the others:\\ndisagreements over authority is a common re-occurrence. This made me\\nmake a connection to how American\\'s at home took to the Vietnam War at\\nthe time ie; they didn\\'t like what they were seeing and hearing thus;\\nwere also against what was happening. The voice of authority is being\\nheard and causing problems not only in the film\\'s platoon but also on\\nthe homeland as people complain.While this is just scratching the surface when it comes to dealing with\\nthe film\\'s theme, Platoon on its own is a brilliantly well crafted;\\natmospheric and engaging film that shocks and pulls at your emotional\\nstrings with haunting music and issues that surround war. War is not\\nmerely two sides fighting in a jungle/desert/town but in-between\\nbattles it\\'s about relations with your comrades; dealing with civilians\\nand sorting out the messes that your squad encounter and I love it when\\nwar films deal with this subject matter. Platoon wastes no time in\\nintroducing itself: the ramp comes down to unveil new supposed cannon\\nfodder as previous dead GIs are carried off. \"Welcome to the \\'Nam.\"\\njibes a soldier. But Platoon is more than fancy film-making; it\\'s a\\nfilm made by Oliver Stone who knows what\\'s what when it comes to\\nVietnam: Taylor is fighting for a society back home; a belief that\\nVietnam (and the rest of the world) shouldn\\'t fall to Communism and\\nit\\'s a society that will ultimately reject him and his actions as it\\nwill all the soldiers: \"F***ing politics\" says one character on\\nmultiple occasions which acts as a substitute for \\'S*** happens\\' only\\nthe guy is forced to be made aware of the predicament he\\'s in and now\\ncannot dismiss where he is and what he\\'s doing in a carefree manner.I feel the best scenes in Platoon are not necessarily the fight scenes\\nalthough they\\'re still impressive. Platoon deals with the immediate\\n\\'just before\\' and immediate aftermath of gunfights. One such scene\\nduring which Taylor experiences the Vietcong for the first time is a\\ngood example: it\\'s night, quiet and Taylor is the only one awake: he\\nlooks down a corridor of jungle and sees figures move towards him. Such\\na scene is shot using Taylor\\'s POV, the reaction of his eyes and the\\nclose up of his head as he is frozen in fear, half putting is hood on.\\nSuch an atmospheric piece of film-making really puts you in the zone\\nand briefly; I was there with Taylor in that clearing. Coming from\\nStone, a veteran; is the portrayal of Vietnam as a place where it\\'s not\\njust the gunfights that are terrible: Sheen narrates his letters to his\\nGrandmother, not his parents showing a further emphasis of being cut\\noff; that he has to dig all the time \\x96 he hates it in a week. Taylor\\nmust also face ants and mosquito\\'s as well as emptying the toilets with\\nfellow soldiers: the gunfights just seem like the filler in-between all\\nthe other crap. That is, after all, what they\\'re there for.Platoon also uses a scene during which the squad encounter a village to\\ngood effect. One reason I loved Apocalypse Now so much was the fact it\\nmoves the action away from the jungle and onto a river but they still\\nencounter seemingly innocent people on a transport boat. In Platoon,\\nthe village is a substitute for the boat as seemingly innocents are\\nsearched and harmed in the aim to find something they can pin them for.\\nNeedless to say, both film\\'s characters have dealt with loss very\\nrecently and are foaming at the mouth in search of revenge. While\\nreminiscent of Soviet film Come and See, the village scene is an actual\\nliquidation and contains, arguably, the film\\'s most disturbing scene\\nwhen a villager is shot and the rest of the family react in the way\\nthey do. A scene involving Taylor and a supposed execution challenges a\\nsoldiers psyche: \\'talking the talk and walking the walk\\' since all\\nVietnamese are apparently the enemy, surely all of them must die at\\nfirst time of asking. Taylor has that chance with a cripple and\\nSergeant Barnes (Berenger) has that chance with a little girl but his\\nactions and macho image clash with his psyche thus putting himself in\\nan eerie position which is very clever and involving film-making.With its portrayal as Vietnam as a place that is not just guns, death\\nand dying but including that as an emotional trigger; Platoon spreads\\nits character development and interaction in a fantastic way whilst\\nremaining real and violent with enough scenes to either have you\\nevoking an emotion of some sort: anger, sadness, relief or any other\\nalong those lines. With a great soundtrack and enough content to truly\\nput anyone off going to war, Platoon must remain in any war genre\\ncannon as well as be used as an example of film-making.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nRated R for Graphic War Violence,Language and Drug Use.After hearing a lot about it, I watched the film \"Platoon\" yesterday on\\nMoviePix.I usually enjoy war films yet there are plenty of war films\\nconsidered classics that I have not seen such as Apocalypse Now or The\\nDeer Hunter.I personally think the film \"Three Kings\" is the greatest\\nwar film of all time.This is either the second or third best war film\\never(Saving Private Ryan was great as well so Im not sure if this would\\nbe second or third).The film has a great cast which consists of Charlie\\nSheen,Tom Beregner,Wilem Dafoe,Forest Whitaker,Keith David,Kevin Dillon\\nand the doctor from the TV series Scrubs.Charlie Sheen is the main\\ncharacter and is said to be a rich kid who dropped out of college to\\nvolunteer to fight in the war.While he\\'s there, he meets plenty of\\npeople who introduce him to marijuana.The film basically shows the\\nVietnam war and how it was like.From what I heard, its a realistic\\naccount.Anyway, if you like war films, check out Platoon, you wont be\\ndisappointed.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nFor about 20 years, from roughly 1950 to 1970, war films were largely\\nabout selfless heroes, often depicting World War II soldiers whose\\nmorality would make the likes of Gandhi or St. Francis of Assis proud.\\nBy the 1970\\'s, film rhetoric about war began to shift to another angle.\\nBy the time of the release of Platoon, films began painting an\\naltogether different portrait of the war experience from the\\nperspective of the private on the ground rather than from a general or\\ncolonel. \"Platoon\" never depicts high-ranking officers discussing\\ntactical plans in an administrative room or racing around in jeeps,\\nsaluting the troops. This is war at the ground level where the battles\\nare fought and people suffer and die, regardless of the cause and the\\nwinners. From the perspective of \"Platoon\", nobody \"wins\".Although war brings out heroism, it more often brings out the worst\\nbecause the stakes are so terribly high. War is rarely about heroes; it\\nis about survival at all costs which can incite much immoral behavior.\\nMore often, soldiers will hide the truth, debase themselves in front of\\nsuperiors, unjustly blame inferiors, exploit circumstances for\\nadvancement, and kill without provocation. These behaviors are true as\\nmuch among officers as enlisted men, and these are the realities that\\nOliver Stone, the director and writer of \"Platoon\", explores instead of\\nthe glossy triumphs of other films. And this is a world he knows\\nintimately because Platoon is a semi-autobiographical account of his\\nexperience in Vietnam.Aside from being one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen,\\n\"Platoon\" is about finding meaning in a situation that appears to be\\nabout nothing more than senseless violence, destruction, and killing.\\nBut that meaning is not equated with the moral metaphors of earlier\\nHollywood offerings whose canvas depicted the good guys and the bad\\nguys in very distinct colors. Here, everything is blurred from the\\nAmerican soldiers to the misty jungles of South Vietnam. Only the poor\\nvillagers who have been caught in the gunfire are truly innocent, and\\nthey are the ones who pay the highest price. The landscape is populated\\nwith the scar-ridden Barnes (Tom Berenger), who regards the war as a\\npersonal proving ground, Elias (Willem Dafoe), the lone moral voice of\\nthe platoon who comes into conflict with Barnes, Lt. Wolfe (Mark\\nMoses), probably an ROTC graduate whose sum total of war experience is\\nmarching around college sophomores at the Ohio University campus, Sgt\\nO\\'Neil (John McGinley), a hot-headed flip-flopper when it comes to\\nloyalty, and Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), who joins the platoon out of\\ncivic duty. But after about 20 minutes, Taylor realizes that no one has\\na sense of duty on this playing field.The strength of \"Platoon\" is how real and devastating it all seems. The\\naudience feels like they are walking along side these men and\\nexperiencing the war with them. And unlike most action movies, which\\nbuild toward climatic sequences, the moments of combat explode from\\nnowhere, often during a subdued moment, which is probably closer to the\\nreal experience of engagement. One of the most frightening moments is\\nwhen Charlie Sheen, just relieved from guard duty late in the night,\\nsees in the distance a group of enemy combatants combing the foliage\\nfor potential prey. We see the enemy from Sheen\\'s point of view,\\nsilently moving through the shrubbery like evil specters. Neither\\nDracula nor Frankenstein were ever this terrifying. The private who\\nrelieved Sheen of guard duty has fallen asleep, putting Sheen in a\\nprecarious predicament. He can neither make a move for his gun which is\\njust out of arm\\'s reach or call to his fellow soldiers lest risk being\\na target of enemy gunfire. What can he do?One other scene I found particularly convincing is a moment late in the\\nfilm when Sgt O\\'Neil played with brilliant angst by John McGinley asks\\nfor a furlough from Sgt Barnes, played with subtle wicked believability\\nby Tom Berenger. When Berenger denies the request, McGinley becomes\\nemotional, letting his inner fears of their coming confrontation out\\ninto the open. I believe that McGinley\\'s performance is one of the best\\nI have yet seen in terms of accurately portraying a soldier\\'s dread of\\ncombat. For a moment, I forgot I was watching a movie and thought I was\\nin Vietnam.These are the kinds of dilemmas that permeate throughout \"Platoon\": no\\nwin situations in which everybody loses, regardless of the outcome.\\nUnlike the war films of the heyday of the studio system that featured\\nthe likes of John Wayne propagating how heroic the Americans were in\\nthe cause of the allied forces in World War II, the message of Platoon\\nis far less romantic but many times more profound. War is hell, and the\\nmessage is to tell others the story of this hell to prevent its\\nrecurrence in the future. In short, war should be prevented at all\\ncosts. It has probably been a profound shock to the filmmakers that\\nthis simple message was disregarded 20 years after the release of this\\nfilm. We are still a country that has not quite learned the lessons of\\nVietnam.\\n',\n",

Along with fellow soldier Private Gardner, Taylor joins an\\nexperienced rifle platoon that has suffered in recent combat\\noperations. His enthusiasm quickly evaporates as he goes on endless\\npatrols and, as a new guy, is assigned to dig foxholes and perform\\nother arduous tasks.On his first night ambush patrol, his unit is set upon by a squad of\\nNorth Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops who walk into the squad\\'s ambush\\nposition. The soldier meant to be on guard duty has fallen asleep.\\nPrivate Gardner dies after being shot while standing up in a firefight\\nand Tex has his leg blown off from a grenade thrown by Sgt. Red O\\'Neil.\\nPrivate Taylor is grazed in the neck.As Chris recovers from his wound\\x97a rite of passage that grants him\\ngreater social contact with his platoon mates\\x97he reveals that he\\ndropped out of college to volunteer for service in Vietnam (Stone\\nhimself had dropped out of Yale twice). He states that he felt college\\nwas leading him nowhere and that it was unfair that lower-class youths\\nhad to carry the burden of the fighting in Vietnam, while rich kids\\ncould avoid the draft. His new friends among the more experienced\\ntroops introduce him to the \"Underworld,\" a bunker converted into a\\npseudo-nightclub, where they smoke marijuana and opium, drink beer, and\\ndance with each other to soul music.After returning to field duty, Chris sees more combat and, during\\nanother patrol, a bunker complex is discovered. (In real life, the 25th\\nDivision encountered tunnel complexes at Cu Chi much like the ones in\\nthe film. During the examination of a campfire left by the enemy, two\\nsoldiers, Sanderson and Sal, are mortally wounded by a booby trap.\\nAfter leaving the bunker complex area, the soldiers come across another\\nmember of their unit, Manny, who has been snatched from his guard duty,\\ntied to a post, and mutilated.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThis semi-autobiographical account of Oliver Stone\\'s time serving in\\nthe Viet Nam war remains as powerful now as it ever was. Essentially a\\nfilmed journal, it is narrated by Chris (Charlie Sheen), a young\\nvolunteer recruit just starting his first tour, and viewed mostly\\nthrough his \"grunt\" perspective we see the nitty gritty of daily life\\nfor the \"grunts\" who paid so dearly for their government\\'s folly during\\nthis terrible conflict. It also illustrates with devastating realism\\nthe attitude many American GI\\'s were forced (or chose) to adopt: that\\nANYONE could be the enemy, even seemingly innocent, benign villagers.\\nThis was very true during that war, and resulted in horrendous civilian\\ncasualties.Chris encounters two \"father figures\" in Sgt Barnes (Tom Berenger) and\\nSgt Elias (Willem Dafoe). Barnes plays the cynical, hardened vet, Elias\\nthe more humane and less psychotic voice of reason and truth. No more\\nis this division evident than in the \"underground\" scenes, where the\\ntwo groups (those loyal to Barnes, the others to Elias) split up, one\\npartaking in cards, whiskey and prayer, while the others retreat to an\\nunderground bunker to indulge in the harder side of Viet Nam life:\\nheroin, weed, and everything \"white rabbit\". Chris takes up with the\\nunderground crowd, headed up by Elias, and including a young Johnny\\nDepp in a role that unfortunately was mostly cut from the final\\nrelease.After a vicious attack on an alleged \"Viet Cong\" village, the two\\ngroups are inexorably pulled apart and towards conflict from within,\\nwhich proves to be far more destructive than the enemies they are\\nsupposed to be fighting against. The real war becomes a personal one,\\nraging inside them all, and illustrated through Chris\\' experiences.The final battle scene perfectly captures the absolute chaos and\\nconfusion, noise and terror of war. You can\\'t really tell where the\\nenemies are, you just know they are there by the bullets whizzing by\\nyour head...Another thing illustrated with realism is the tunnel rat sequence with\\nWillem Dafoe infiltrating a Viet Cong tunnel. While I would have liked\\nto have seen more of this (as it was a HUGE part of the initial stages\\nof that war) it was good to at least see it presented once.(As a side note, the Viet Cong tunnel system was INCREDIBLE. If you are\\nkeen to find out more, track down the book \"The Tunnels of Cu Chi\"\\ncan\\'t remember the authors\\' names but it\\'s a great story, told from\\nboth sides, about the extensive network of tunnels the Viet Cong dug,\\neven right UNDER some American army camps!) The \"Gold Edition\" contains\\na Director\\'s Commentary and also a commentary track from military\\nadviser Dale Dye (USMC Ret) who also served in Viet Nam.While budget and resources limited the scope of what could be done here\\n(no CGI), Oliver Stone dispenses with big spectacle battle scenes and\\ninstead focuses on a riveting, engaging and indeed very moving\\nstoryline, complemented by great actors and some really nice\\nphotography and production design of the Vietnamese jungle and\\nvillages, American camps etc.Now while I haven\\'t seen EVERY war movie out there, this one certainly\\nstruck me as a definitive \"anti-war\" message (with its bloody, brutally\\nrealistic portrayal of the violence and insanity that goes hand in hand\\nwith war), the only recent war movie to match it, I believe, is \"The\\nThin Red Line\".\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThis film shows the bad war conditions with professionally designed\\nscenes. Soldiers, from U.S., leave their comfortable houses and\\nfamilies to fight against men near Cambodia so our main character. He\\nhad not been thinking of coming across this situation like that.\\nMoreover, we see discrimination in army. our new guy's team is charged\\nalthough it is not their turn. But several soldiers are not only to\\nagainst the opposition forces. They are also severing to local people,\\nraping, offending and killing,without learning the facts. The severe\\nsergeant kills the other sergeant who is against these out-law acts.\\nSometimes, desire to become the leader or take revenge become stronger\\nthan desire to live. Wee see that our man had been frightened of any\\nlittle attacks by enemy, but, in the end, he becomes very brave man,\\nthanks to hard conflicts. Also, the cast is great.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon is as gritty, intense and devastating as any war film you're\\nlikely to find, in any language. Without a profound stance against the\\npro-war characters, like Apocalypse Now! does, it presents the\\nrealities of Vietnam. The drug use, the individualistic conflicts, the\\ntension within the army and the varying degrees of commitment within\\nplatoons. Charlie Sheen, surprisingly, is excellent, but his\\nperformance does not compare with the Oscar worthy performances of Tom\\nBerringer and Willem Dafoe. They are both spectacular, bringing the\\nharsh kill or be killed mentality of Vietnam to life, on both sides of\\nthe Vietnam debate. The film is gritty, there are no frills about the\\nlook of the picture, the grainy, washed out palettes illuminate the\\ndestitute nature of the soldiers, while simultaneously bringing out the\\nmajesty of the natural side of Vietnam. Oliver Stone provides an\\nexcellent counterpoint to most other Vietnam movies. There are no\\nwinners here, all of the characters find themselves suffering for the\\nsake of political strife at large. Oliver Stone's film is heavy to its\\ncore, bringing the soldiers, and the civilians, sacrifice in war to\\npoignant stand still as the staggering numbers of war causalities\\nbecome people you've watched struggle through personal loss and moral\\nmarginalization. Truly one of the best war films ever made.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nLike most Vietnam veterans, my father would probably NOT want to see\\nthis movie. All these years later he still won\\'t talk about his\\nexperiences there.This movie is violent and confronting - particularly with how it\\ndepicts the treatment of the Vietnamese civilians. Some truly\\ndisturbing scenes are included that will bring tears to your eyes. You\\nwish that none of it ever happened but sadly that is not the case.All of the actors are perfectly cast and perform admirably in what must\\nhave been similar conditions to what the real soldiers would have\\nexperienced during the war.The soundtrack is surprisingly good - particularly the extensive use of\\nthe classical Samuel Barber\\'s \"Adagio for Strings\". A similar affect\\nwas gained with the use of Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni\\'s Adagio which is\\nused right at the end of Peter Weir\\'s \"Galipoli\" (1981) and includes\\nsome great classics of the era like \"Hello - I love you\", \"Dock of the\\nBay\" and \"Respect\". Gotta love 60\\'s music! You might cringe at the\\nbehaviour displayed by some of the US troops - sadly this is not\\naltogether unfactual. It is a violent film also so definitely not for\\nthe squeamish.Any good movie is one that makes you think \"what would I have done in\\nthat situation?\". For me this includes the treatment of the Vietnamese\\npeople and the battles. This is one of those movies.Recommended! Confronting but Ultimately a superior war movie about a\\nwar that should never have occurred.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nDirector Oliver Stone drawing on his own experience from his days as a\\nsolider in Vietnam, scores a big hit here in 1986 with \"Platoon\" a\\nbrutal war drama with conflict about. Chris Taylor(Charlie Sheen) is a\\nyoung man who\\'s dropped out of college for the love of his country so\\nhe goes off to fight in Vietnam. Of course the big enemy is the Viet\\nCong, yet so much more is at stake and much is learned during this\\nbrutal tour. This film is just perfect the way it shows how intense and\\nbrutal war can be, as evidenced by the bloody and ambush attack scenes,\\nas a viewer can feel the hurt, pain and exhaustion of the soldiers.\\nThis platoon company has plenty of conflicts, differences of opinion,\\nand culture problems all within themselves. Those themes and problems\\nmake this film all the more important as the viewer will come to value\\nlife just like the central character of Chris Taylor. The performances\\ngiven from Sheen is good but fails in comparison to his two commanding\\nofficers played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe, especially Berenger\\'s\\nis outstanding because he\\'s so direct and serious. You will find plenty\\nof pot smoking, foul language, and death with this picture, but that\\'s\\njust typical stuff in war. After it all a viewer should feel proud to a\\nsolider and hold them in high value because they help provide our\\ncountries freedom of life. Great film and well deserving of the 1986\\nbest picture.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe way how Oliver Stone describes the soldiers in his Oscar-winning\\nVietnam film \"Platoon\" is similar to what we\\'ve already seen in\\n\"Apocalypse Now\" for example. He shows us a bunch of mainly poor\\npeople, a drug taking behaviour beyond the border of the acceptable and\\nmilitary leaders that are anything else than exemplary. But this film\\nwants much more to be a vivid documentation of reality. Stone wants us\\nto feel the deadly insects on our own skins, he wants us to feel the\\nheat, he wants us to feel the fear, what it must be like to sit in the\\nmiddle of an unknown jungle knowing that the enemy is going to attack\\nany second. He wants all of this, so that the viewer can at least get a\\nglimpse why the soldiers are carrying out this horrible massacre. He\\ndoesn\\'t want to apologize it, but give us a psychological insight.\\nUntil the massacre the film is extraordinary good, after that I had a\\nbit of a problem with the extreme black/white characterization of Elias\\nand Barnes.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThat's what the movie does with you and anyone who watches it. There is\\na kind of no-holds barred feeling to it. And it's more than believable\\ncoming from a man who's been there (Vietnam) and has done his time ...Oliver Stone sure knows how to make a movie about war, especially one\\nabout the Vietnam war. Although he was a somewhat acclaimed writer\\nbefore Platoon (think of the Scarface script he did for Brian De\\nPalma), this movie marked his real beginning to cult director and known\\ncelebrity. And this movie or the making of it is filled with beautiful\\ntrivia, which you can find here at IMDb. But even without those\\nstories, it's a remarkable film, that anyone who has the slightest\\ninterest in war movies should watch! Nuff said! :o)\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI remember when this movie released nationally when I was only a kid.\\nI\\'m only in my 30s and was still a toddler when the evacuation of\\nSaigon commenced, however I have been touched by the Vietnam Conflict\\nin many areas of my personal life. Having viewed this feature over and\\nagain, it wasn\\'t until I watched Charles Keyselyak\\'s documentary on the\\nmaking of this film when I realized and remembered the full scope of\\nthis magnificent piece of American cinema (one of the view to win best\\nfeature as well as best director). As one user on this board\\nilluminated, Platoon, \"was also a success at the box office grossing\\n$250,000,000 world wide, making it the third highest grossing film of\\n1986.\" One of those three films was the jingoistic piece of fluff \"Top\\nGun\"; a film so anathema in tone to Platoon and iconic of the\\nReagan-Era. It was a privilege to view this film as a 12 year old boy\\nand I went on to study History at the graduate level, this film\\ncontributing greatly to my ambition to understand how these moments,\\nbrutal periods in history transpire. My first employer had been shot up\\non an armored personnel carrier on the Cambodian border, my best\\nfriend\\'s father had served in a tank company and was very troubled\\nemotionally and the man who helped my family adopt my younger sister\\nfrom South Korea lost both legs to an anti- personnel mine. I\\'ll never\\nforget seeing, at the time, adult men leaving one of the theaters in my\\nhome town weeping. I didn\\'t understand what was going on at the time,\\nbut this is one of the most poignant memories I carry of this film and\\nits impact. Sadly, Stone says in the documentary on the film that he\\nhopes younger generations will be smarter, \"when some politician tries\\nto sell them a used war like this one\". As of 2007, being in Iraq, it\\nseems America has not learned the lessons, the sharp, divisive,\\nhorrific lessons of Vietnam enlighten the country and her government.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThe most common complaint i\\'ve heard about Platoon is its depiction of\\nThe two SGT\\'s (willem Dafoe and tom Berenger). The two are polar\\nopposites.Dafoe is the good-hearted Sgt. who takes the side of newcomer\\nprivate (Charlie sheen). Tom Berenger\\'s character is as cold-hearted as\\ncould be. Any possible way that oliver stone could make berenger\\'s\\ncharacter hated by viewers, he did. An example of this is when berenger\\nshoots one of the frantic Vietnamese women, and then you hear the\\nscreaming of her daughter and husband. It doesn\\'t take long to see that\\nBerenger is an undisguised monster.Is this portrayal of these two characters exactly realistic? Probably\\nnot. I would hope there are very few soldiers as wicked as Berenger is\\nin this movie. However, what is really important about this movie is\\nnot how realistic or unrealistic the characters are. The fact that\\ndafoe and Berenger are so different could reflect the different\\nfeelings that some soldiers felt. Then again, this is an oliver stone\\nfilm, so raw emotion, realistic or unrealistic is expected and\\nnaturally it adds to the feeling of sadness and tragedy that is\\ndisplayed in the film.There really is no war film that is entirely realistic. To me war films\\nusually express certain exaggerations in order to emphasize something\\nthe film was trying to say about war. \"The Deer Hunter\", for example,\\nis famous for its scenes of American soldiers playing Russian roulette\\nwhile being held prisoner. There has never been any exact recording of\\nthis happening, but this game was trying to express the brutality of\\nthe war (personally i though Deer Hunter was a pretty weak movie\\noverall, but that is a different discussion). In apocalypse now, the\\ninsanity of colonel kurtz, expresses some of the insanity of the\\nVietnam war. Overall Platoon is one of the best war films. It covers a\\nvery wide spectrum of war, but also it helps get the message\\nacross-that war is bad, whether or not this is always expressed\\nrealistically.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nplatoon is the best Vietnam war film that was ever made it is so\\nrealistic u will be transported into the Nam yourself with the grunts\\non the front line in the movie with each character having different\\ntraits and the two commanding officers Barnes and alias having opposing\\npersonality's which creates a civil war between the platoon and the\\nsubject which is Charlie Sheen a educated young man who joins the war\\neffort for patriotic purposes but soon discovers the true reality of\\nwar i have given this movie a 10 out of 10 vote because i feel this\\nmovie has saved my life Oliver stone made this movie having served in\\nVietnam himself to expose the horror and insanity of war which exposes\\nthe propaganda tactics of American and British government's which try\\nto get young men and women to join the armed forces for political\\npurposes only to be killed or maimed in action when i was 16 i saw this\\nmovie and it made me think twice about joining the British army i thank\\ngod now as i could have been drafted to Iraq and maybe killed or\\ninjured in a pointless war effort which is similar to what vets went\\nthrough in Vietnam remember this is only my opinion yours maybe\\ndifferent but watch this and enjoy a masterpiece of movie making peace\\n:-)\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI don\\'t think it was the definitive Vietnam war movie. Indeed, that\\nmovie probably hasn\\'t been made. The real issue that Stone didn\\'t get\\nto is the one the generation that fought WWII recognized which is the\\nfutility of war only lies with the foot soldier not with the higher\\nechelons in the chain of command. War is an ends to a political means\\nno matter whether it is a \"righteous war\" or not. This will always be\\ntrue and is the reason even radical Islamics are waging the war they\\nare waging against the rest of the world to achieve their goal of\\nIslamic domination. Same old story, new era. The issue was that the\\ncharacter of Chris and the others in his platoon held out hope of\\nliving when a soldier like Barnes has already recognized he is dead\\nwhich allows him to function as a soldier needs to in war. That is the\\nessence of Barnes\\' statement when he asks the men after pulling the\\nknife on Chris \"killin\\', what do you know about killin\\'?\" I thought\\nsome of the drama was very predictable and contrived as well. The idea\\nto put the American soldier in a bad light in many instances. I mean,\\nhow can you point up some atrocities committed by Americans if you\\naren\\'t going to show the atrocities they endured? No\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\"Platoon\" was definitely a throwback to the old war movies, with some\\nextra punch added. It involves the characters more than most modern\\nmovies, and the characters are delineated. You can tell one from\\nanother in camera shots, unlike \"Hamburger Hill\", which is a melange of\\nshots in which you can\\'t possibly tell one character from another. It\\ninvolves a protagonist who is also a throwback to the old war movie, a\\nman out of of his element, learning to deal with people he usually\\ndidn\\'t. He is a \"rich kid\", but a thoroughly likable, believable rich\\nkid who does a lot of thinking. I\\'m sure you\\'ve already heard about the\\ntwo NCOs whose names are synonyms for the kinds of soldiers they are\\n\"Barnes\" and \"Lyle\". The acting, directing, and writing are all\\nexceptional. The action and dialogue mingle in a very entertaining,\\nlogical, and informative process. What the film also shows is the way\\nof life in that era. It is hard to think about supporting the \"Barnes\"\\npoint of view today in an era in which we are so well informed, but in\\nthe late sixties and seventies, when Americans were spoon fed only bits\\nand pieces, even by the press (I was a high schooler then, and believe\\nme, the war was downplayed. The killings and battles were described as\\nsmall skirmishes then by the press.) Probably more than half of\\nAmericans would have been \"Barnes\" supporters then, while his\\nsupporters today would be the rich mercantile types, the very naive,\\nand the very uneducated (in other words, Republicans). However, when\\nBarnes kills the granny, he probably would have a bit more than half\\nagainst him, and the film depicts this. Make no mistake, Barnes is the\\nepitome of evil, however. And other characters more in the middle\\nprobably reflect how most people would react, Particularly O\\'Neil, who\\nprobably represents the actions most of us would have taken. Anyone who\\never thought about being in combat has felt positive they would have\\ndone exactly what he did in battle, and would have said exactly the\\nsame words he said afterwards. One thing lost is the captain\\'s guilt in\\nall of this. He proclaims that he will investigate and prosecute\\nillegal killing, but then proclaims \"Not now!\" and puts Lyle\\'s life in\\njeopardy from his comrade quite knowingly. The captain is too smart to\\nget caught, but his mercantile character should not be overlooked when\\nteachers show this film to students. It is he, more than the junio\\nofficer, who is truly the \"butt buddy\" of Sgt. Barnes, allowing Barnes\\nto deal life and death and play God. The movie makes clear how he even\\ncheats his friends. He is no comrade, and all his actions are meant to\\nget his comrades killed. The mood of the film is also magnificent. And\\nafter seeing it, I can\\'t imagine anyone hearing \"Sweat of My Tears\"\\nwithout thinking about it. The famous death scene of a certain main\\ncharacter gets the advertising it deserves for being so well made. I\\ncould go on for weeks about the assets of this film. The best war film\\nsince \"Jungle Fighters\", which was made in the same spirit.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon is the best Vietnam War movie ever. This movie was better than\\nFull Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now. This is one of Oliver Stone's\\nbest movies.

       " u'\\n\"Platoon\" is one of those films where you really feel like you\\nunderstand the topic better. The film is almost like a documentary, as\\nOliver Stone based the script on his experiences as a soldier in\\nVietnam. The characters in the movie are based on real people he met\\nwhile during his time in the battlefields and fox holes.The three elements that make this movie great are listed in the title.\\nThose three things are the score, the director, and the cast. The score\\nof this movie is very haunting and powerful, taking you to the\\natmosphere of the film. Some might argue that is over-used, but I don\\'t\\nmind at all. The main theme is incredible, filled with a sorrow. Having\\nalso watched \"The War at Home\", I would say that the score bears some\\nresemblance to the main theme in \"Platoon\". The songs used are also\\nvery smart choices. Examples are \"White Rabbit\", and \"Tracks of My\\nTears\".For the director\\'s role, only a Vietnam veteran could have done such a\\ngood job (except for maybe Steven Spielberg). Oliver Stone put his\\nheart, soul, and his past into this film. The characters in the platoon\\nare based on real people that Oliver had known in Vietnam. The central\\ncharacter of Chris is based on himself. This was a struggle to make,\\nand his hard work paid off, in the form of an Oscar, and in the box\\noffice success of the film.The cast is a young one, a cast that had a lot of promise. It was a\\ncast of wide variety. Some were established TV actors, like Tom\\nBerenger and Willem Dafoe. Others had older relations in the film\\nbusiness, like Kevin Dillon and Francesco Quinn. Some, like Forest\\nWhitaker and Keith David, would go on to continue a mediocre film\\ncareer. Still others were unknown at the time,but would soon rise high,\\nlike Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen. Behind the scenes, they were\\ntrained in army-fashion, they were only spoken to by their character\\nnames, and they grew very resentful of it by the time that filming\\nstarted. What then resulted was a very convincing bunch of acting, and\\nthe movie goes up many notches because of it. Special mention should go to all of them, but some really up there\\ninclude the three main stars. Charlie Sheen is a naive volunteer who\\ngrows up in the face of war. Berenger and Dafoe play the two main\\nsergeants of the platoon, and they are constantly on edge with each\\nother. Dafoe is a decent person who realizes that this will be a defeat\\nfor his country. Berenger is the soldier\\'s soldier: a hardened killer\\nwho is almost tunnel-visioned in his efforts in the war. Then there\\'s\\nthe men of the platoon. Francesco Quinn is Rhah, the drug addict who is\\nalso very streetwise in the platoon\\'s \\'politics\\'. Kevin Dillon is\\nBunny, a flawless example of how war makes young teenagers into\\nrapists, killers, or worse, corpses.\"Platoon\" is an eye-opener for those who know very little of the\\nVietnam War. The movie shows what the soldiers went through for a\\ncountry in which many had almost no future. It is almost a romantic\\ntragedy, the way it plays out, and is a powerfully emotional piece of\\ncinema.\\n',\n",

After spending three days in the medical center, he came back and some\\nof the platoon mates welcomed Taylor with open arms: He was now part pf\\nthe platoon. He joined Elias\\' (William Dafoe) group, which was more of the wild,\\nparty animal bunch. Taylor increasingly became more fearful for his\\ndeath, and because of that started to act in ways he never thought he\\nwould do before. This was evident in the scene in the village raid\\nwhere he shoots at a boy\\'s foot to make him dance. He became overly\\nfrustrated with the boy, who would not listen to his instructions, and\\njust snapped. After the incident, Taylor broke down and cried,\\nrealizing he did something horrible. It wasn\\'t until the following\\nscene that made Taylor a killing machine. When Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) left Elias by himself, telling that the\\nplatoon was moving forward, when in fact the platoon was moving back\\nthat Taylor snapped. He thought something was fishy and went back to\\nfind Elias. He instead found Barnes, who said Elias was dead. Taylor\\nreluctantly went back to the chopper, where he found Elias, shot and\\nwounded, running with an enormous limp for about 50 Vietcong soldiers.\\nElias then did a Jesus like pose and fell dead on his face. Taylor knew\\nright then that he had to kill Barnes by the end of his time at\\nVietnam. In the final battle, Taylor was in the middle of a huge ambush that\\nwiped out almost the entire U.S camp base. Taylor, seeing Barnes\\nfighting for his life with another soldier, tried to help Barnes kill\\nthe Vietcong soldier. However, Barnes turned on Taylor and pointed a\\nknife at his stomach, when all of a sudden a huge bomb goes off and\\neveryone is knocked to the ground. The next scene we see is the next morning, Taylor gets up and limps\\naround in serious pain. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Barnes\\ncrawling on the ground. Barnes demands a medic, but quickly realizes\\nthat Taylor will not get one. Taylor points his gun at Barnes, which\\nmade Barnes say, \"Common shoot me...\" and with that Taylor shoots\\nBarnes three times in the stomach. Taylor is then put in a helicopter\\nto a medic, where he throws his hands up in the air in joy, but yet\\nsadness because of Elias. I thought Oliver Stone did an outstanding job of portraying Vietnam and\\nwhat went on in the platoon. I have seen many biographies and\\ndocumentaries in school about soldiers in Vietnam and everything that I\\nhave seen was dead on in this movie. Charlie Sheen nailed the part of\\nChris Taylor with a progression of scared, to angry, to not caring\\nabout his life with his reckless killing in the last scene. This role\\nlead him to stardom with \"Wall Street\" and \"Major League\" to follow.\\nWilliam Dafoe also did a great job as always as playing Elias. Elias\\ntakes Taylor under his wing and is a man who is reckless in partying,\\nbut plays by the rules of war. Lastly, Berenger nailed the part of\\nBarnes with his mean streak, and look that got him the part of playing\\nthe tough Bear Bryant years later. Berenger\\'s scowl gave fear in\\neveryones eyes, especially O\\'Neill\\'s (John C. McGlincy). This movie won best picture in 1986, but should also go down as one of\\nthe great war movies every made.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon is the most real war movie I have ever seen. It is brutal and\\nunforgiving. While watching, I almost felt as if I were there with\\nthem, that's how real it was. But Platoon is also an extremely touching\\nand depressing movie due to the performances and the amazing\\nsoundtrack. This movie is probably more real due to the fact that\\nOliver Stone is a Vietnam Vet, his experiences help make this movie\\nreal. Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger all give outstanding\\nperformances. There all very real and most importantly, convincing. As\\nI said before, the soundtrack really makes the movies impact much\\nharder. Especially after a particularly brutal village attack.This is one of my favourite war movies and easily the most real war\\nmovie I have ever seen.5/5.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nPlatoon ****People who have seen Platoon say that they didn't like it. Why? I can't\\ntell you but I have to say it's one of the greatest war movies of all\\ntime. People might put Full Metal Jacket (Another great war movie), as\\none of the best war movies before Platoon, but Platoon shouldn't be\\ncompared to Full Metal Jacket. Just because both movies took place in\\nVietnam doesn't mean they are the same movie. Platoon is about lies and\\ndeceit among a platoon. Instead of fighting the enemy, they fight each\\nother, and they get blind sited. Yes the movie may seem more of a\\ncharacter study then a war movie but so what, The Deer Hunter was more\\nof a character study and like Platoon, they were given the Academy\\nAward for best picture. Platoon is about the soldiers and what they\\nwould do in war, not about killing someone.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nI liked Platoon because it was able to achieve an intenseness needed\\nfor an effective war movie - and then tell a story. A great contributor\\nto the tone of the film was an excellent cast. Everyone had distinct\\nand believable personalities. In fact, because they were believable,\\nthe story can be effective. We can understanding and experience the\\ngood and bad of human nature.One aspect of the movie that I really liked was lack of constant 60s\\nmusic playing in the background - I think a war movie (for me) works\\nbetter than infusing it with period rock music.A good indicator that a movie is working is the presence of suspense -\\nand there was plenty of good suspense throughout this movie. Another\\ngood indicator was the presence of highly emotional scenes. Stone did a\\ngreat job with some heart-wrenching scenes - shocking and horrific and\\nall too believable. Finally, Stone put in some good surprises - great\\nwriting job.In general, if you're in the mood for a good war movie, Platoon is an\\nexcellent choice - one of the few I'd recommend.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nDear Readers, I am a fan of war films. I love the vast multitudes of\\ngreat war films from the 60's, 70's, and 80's like The Dirty Dozen, Von\\nRyan's Express, Stalag 17, and, of course, Patton. I also like the\\nrecent realistic ones likes Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and\\nWindtalkers. One of the best, though, is Oliver Stone's Platoon.Haunting and Powerful, Platoon is a work of art. Using Samuel Barber's\\nAdagio for Strings as the main theme was a stroke of Genius. I can\\nnever listen to that song without thinking of the Jungles of Vietnam\\nand Helicopters. Tom Berenger is pure evil in this film as a corrupt,\\npower-crazy soldier who destroys the weak to make way for the strong.\\nCharlie Sheen embodies innocence lost in this film, as he gradually\\nloses touch with his views on life and becomes a killer. It's Willem\\nDafoe who gives the best performance in this film as a good-natured\\nsoldier who tries to help the newbies get through the nightmare that is\\nthe Vietnam War.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nEven for \"Platoon\", a quote from \"Apocalypse Now\" says it all: \"a bunch\\nof 4-star clowns were giving the whole circus away\" is just as relevant\\nhere. Add to that, two US presidents who were busy lying to us. Those\\n\"users\" who wrote \"an army who fights itself cannot win the war.\" also\\ntells a loud tale. Once the draft set-in, it was all down-hill, because\\nthe younger the soldiers were, the more unprepared they were for\\njungle-warfare- maybe all those guys who went to Canada had insights\\nthe other grunts didn\\'t, plus officers who were totally unprepared for\\ncombat and useless at trying to lead. Kids who had just graduated from\\nhigh-school and were reveling in their budding manhood, from owning\\ntheir first automobile certainly weren\\'t ready to leave the nest of\\nhome and fight in a savage jungle. AND - I want to correct\\n\"Polaris_P.b\" for saying there were too many Black soldiers in the\\nmovie - wake-up, guy: that race was the most vulnerable to be drafted\\nand volunteering, because they had no future to look forward to. They\\nwere about half of the fighting-force. You noticed their presence in\\nTHIS movie, because in other wars they were segregated from the general\\ntroops, and ALWAYS had the most dangerous assignments. Lots of\\nhorrendous tales to be told about them....Although much was made about Charlie Sheen almost being eaten alive -\\nseveral times - by ants, no one mentioned the two cobras he encountered\\nat close-range. That would have kept me out of the jungle entirely.This movie is near being flawless, but that characteristic can be\\nreally gleaned only after several viewings. With the war raging between\\nBeringer\\'s and Dafoe\\'s characters - and the danger of not knowing whom\\nyou are shooting at - how could there be any morality among the troops?\\nI worked in Hawai\\'i during that war, which was a big \"R-&-R\" retreat. I\\nmet so many guys who were just as frightened at every sound THERE as\\nthey must have been in Vietnam. I suspect a lot of them went AWOL from\\nthere. As so many \"users\" picked-up, the whole thing was about staying\\nalive. Even if they did, they had no idea how terribly they would be\\ntreated when they went home. \"War is hell\" is just an announcement that\\nthe war to keep your sanity, at home after the battle, would be almost\\nas bad. See \"The War at Home\", which just happens to star Martin Sheen\\nas the father of a Vietnam veteran......one of his real sons.This movie dulls the senses even as you watch it. I get so involved, I\\ncan\\'t even separate the characters - I\\'m amazed I can recognize the\\nthree main actors, and that\\'s only because they\\'re in almost every\\nscene. I never did recognize Johnny Depp, who was almost chosen as the\\nmain character, but was too young.....and Oliver Stone predicted he\\nwould be a future major-star. As hateful as he was, Beringer was\\nbrilliant, as was Defoe underplaying his more humane officer with\\nbravery to spare, as was Charlie Sheen\\'s ability to act from\\n\"cheese-d--k\" to seasoned fighter. The whole scene of destroying the\\npeasant village was too realistic and heartbreaking. Sheen\\'s rescuing\\nthe girls from being raped, outstanding - after all, \"rape and pillage\"\\nwere a bi-product of every war since the beginning of time.Turning our youngest men into \"killing-machines\" (\"Jarhead\") absolutely\\nguarantees they will never live a normal life. If a movie can arouse\\nsuch fear, how much worse can actually taking part in one be? The big\\nbattle at the end of the movie - when the soldiers are begging to be\\nspared from close fighting and willing to injure themselves to get out\\nof it - certainly points-out American troops can\\'t always hack-it when\\nthe going gets rough. Especially, when the enemy has been fighting\\nlonger - and has a stronger determination to win because they are\\nfighting on their own territory - as the VC were, and about the same in\\nIraq. If this country has ever fought a deceitful war, that is it.Oliver did create a real classic - how skillfully he controlled every\\naspect, how brilliant was his script to depict the only salvation for\\nthe troops was to get lost in drugs and alcohol. The cinematography,\\nsimply gorgeous; special effects, totally real-looking; \"Elias\\'\" final\\nscene expected but devastating; Sheen\\'s shooting Beringer, bravo !\\nEvery actor was stellar and the crew brought all of their skills to the\\nfront to make this movie timeless - with a deep prayer \"can\\'t we just\\nget along?\" Required viewing for everyone........even the weak-hearted.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI saw this about 29 years after it came out. I have to say that I've\\nseen lots of Vietnam movies and this one, though slightly pretentious\\nat times, qualifies as one of the top 4-5. Scholars researching Oliver\\nStone 30 years from now should definitely look at Platoon as being the\\nrare vehicle that brings the best out of a skilled director.Platoon has a message to get across, and it indeed does; it beats you\\nover the head with the message. You accept it though, because the tone\\nof the voice delivering the message is so strong and powerful. You\\nwatch this movie like you watch a drunk driver whose crash is\\ninevitable on the freeway.Anyway, the coolest thing about this movie is that Charlie Sheen\\nvirtually mirrors his father's performance from Apocalypse Now. Same\\ntheme, same story arc-both brought out beautifully in what may be\\nCharlie Sheen's finest performance in film (it was all downhill from\\nhere). It's basically been a story told before...Charlie Sheen's\\ncharacter, Chris, comes to Vietnam wide eyed and idealistic, but the\\nwar turns him. That's all you really need to know about this movie. So\\nwatch the movie if you like movies of this genre.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nTwenty years later, after PLATOON was released in 1986 and brought some\\nof the horrors of the Vietnam experience to the public's\\nmedia-jaundiced eye, at last the film can be seen and discussed\\ncritically. 'At last', in this viewer's vocabulary, includes the fact\\nthat more time for healing from actually being in Vietnam in 1968 and\\n1969 has passed, making the response to Oliver Stone's film more\\nrational. Now the film is a film, not a nightmare memory inducer, and\\nthat fact in no way diminishes the power of the message.Oliver Stone wrote and directed this musing on the effect of war on the\\npsyche and emotional crippling that Vietnam produced in those who\\nsurvived. Stone was there and that makes his cinematic lead Chris\\n(Charlie Sheen), an random kid from a privileged family who volunteers\\nto go to Vietnam for 'patriotic reasons', an exception in the platoon\\nto which he is assigned, the leader of which is the mentally broken and\\nemotionally scarred Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Chris'\\npositive influence is Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), and the two are\\nthe polar opposites of evil and good. But the main characters of this\\ngripping film are the other kids who daily are subjected to the horrors\\nof life in the Vietnam jungles with the atrocious living conditions of\\nfilth, rain, heat, vermin, and the constant threat of the VC hidden in\\nthe atmosphere, ready to kill them at any moment. And these conditions\\nalong with the destructive effects of the government's insane war\\nresult in mankind stooping to its lowest level, such as decimating a\\nvillage of people in the manner of My Lai.The combat scenes are viscerally rigorous and well staged, but the odd\\nthing about seeing this film as a veteran of that war is how watered\\ndown the atrocities now seem: scenes of dead bodies, both US and VC,\\nlying on the ground or being scooped into mass burials ignores the fact\\nthat in reality what would have been seen are strewed body parts,\\nunrecognizably torn by booby traps, mines, and powerful gunfire.But there is only so much the public can tolerate and so the film must\\nbe tidied up a bit. The impact remains in the eyes of the actors called\\nupon to recreate the veterans. Stone does his best to show the insanity\\nof war, a statement as powerful as any that war must not be the answer\\nin today's world. And we haven't learned. And that is what this viewer\\nis remembering. Grady Harp\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI\\'ve heard of \"Platoon\" when I was searching for a movie that would\\ncontain violence that is not used to entertain, but as a symbolic\\nviolence. I decided to rent the movie... But I got more than I\\nexpected.\"Platoon\" is a very shocking anti-war film that tells the incredible\\nstory of a young American soldier named Chris Taylor who left college\\nin order to fight in Vietnam. He quickly regrets his choice as he\\nexperiences the horrors and the wounds that come with the war.We see a lot of combat movies, but few come with the real reality\\n(weird words, but that\\'s how I see it) of the Vietnam war: little\\nhurting bugs, humidity, rations, marijuana to escape reality and those\\ndisgusting tasks, such as emptying the pots that the soldiers use as\\ntoilets. This IS reality. Director Oliver Stone took out his own\\nmemories of the Vietnam and he wonderfully put them into the movie.Outside of Taylor, Sgt. Barnes (played by Tom Berenger) and Sgt. Elias\\n(played by Willem Defoe), it\\'s very difficult to follow the characters.\\nThe main reason is that they all look alike. That\\'s one of the movie\\'s\\nhidden geniuses: Stone presents ordinary looking guys who surely got\\nnormal lives in the States and their insertion into the jungle war.\\nBarnes and Elias are the only ones who are highly recognizable and\\nthey\\'ve got their own reason. Barnes owns a frightening face and a\\nhorrific soul, which stick perfectly together. Barnes is an inhuman\\nsoldier and the scenes where he intends to kill the innocent villagers\\nof a Vietnamese village are a nice reflect of his personality.Sgt. Elias is mainly recognizable because of his appearance. His face\\ncan\\'t be missed and he wears an almost-trademark headband. Also\\ntrademark is his morality that makes him the least threatening of the\\nsoldiers we see in the film, along with Taylor. Elias also appears in\\nthe most shocking scene of the movie: as he\\'s shot in the back by the\\nVietnamese soldiers, he lifts his arms towards the American helicopters\\nin the sky and this is his final movements. This scene has an almost\\nreligious mood.Also shocking are the soldiers\\' questionable moralities, which are mold\\nby the difficult context of war and the tyranny of their superiors,\\nmainly Barnes. There\\'s also this scene where a barely wounded Taylor\\nlooks beside him and sees a young fresh deer.Overall, \"Platoon\" is a perfect example of a proverbial anti-war film\\nand its shocking images and lessons provide reflections on war and\\nsoldiers for anyone who watches it.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n#1 Best Film of 1986Marvelous, Incredible, Powerful, Amazing. Those are just a few words to\\ndescribe Oliver Stone's first Vietnam picture. It's a film so\\ngroundbreaking and authentic, that it takes the place as the very best\\nfilm ever, ever made about Vietnam. Stone truly knows the hardships and\\nterrors Vietnam had in store for every soldier involved, he knows this\\nfrom his own experience (he fought in Vietnam as an infantry man -- he\\nobviously survived). I'm pretty sure Oliver Stone places some of his\\nown terrifying experiences in this war flick, but I don't know for\\nsure. All I know is whatever Stone based the situations and experiences\\nin this on (or if he didn't base it on anything at all), he succeeds in\\nthrilling and enthralling us throughout the entire runtime of\\n'Platoon'.The film takes place in the middle of the Vietnam conflict, and follows\\nPrivate Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). He's a honest, young soldier, who\\nexperiences horrors in war that change him forever. Besides fighting\\nthe enemy, Pvt. Taylor finds himself smack-dab in the middle of a\\nbrutal conflict between the American soldiers, involving a hardened,\\nruthless, and cruel scar-faced staff sergeant, Barnes (Tom Berenger),\\nand a laid back, liberal hippie Sergeant, Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe),\\nwho befriends Pvt. Taylor. Pvt. Taylor gets involved with this, and\\nthere's no predicting what happens next, in this macabre war story\\nfilled to the brim with deception, violence, treachery and\\nlife-changing decisions. This true to life Vietnam tale packs an\\nall-star cast including Forest Whitaker (Ghost Dog: The Way of the\\nSamurai), Francesco Quinn (Indio), John C. McGinley (TV's Scrubs),\\nKevin Dillon (The Doors), Keith David (Pitch Black), Tony Todd\\n(Candyman), Chris Pedersen (Point Break) and a young Johnny Depp\\n(Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Neverland), back when no one knew\\nwho he was.One of the many things that make this Best Picture winner so great, is\\nOliver Stone's keen and meticulous sense of direction and especially\\nauthenticity (for example, when the men are sitting around waiting for\\nbattle they are covered in insects, and exhausted from the hot sun and\\nhumidity of the jungle.) This is definitely Stone's greatest\\ndirectorial achievement, and it's also his very best film. Oliver Stone\\nalso delivers a riveting screenplay with many scenes of engaging\\ndialogue and interesting conversations (which were probably very close\\nto what the real soldiers who fought over there talked about, ie, drugs\\n(sometimes), women, what they are going to do when they get out, sports\\nteams, etc.) The acting is nothing short of amazing in this romp of a\\nfilm. Charlie Sheen is very convincing as the main character/narrator\\ntrying to adapt to the harsh life-style U.S. soldiers had to endure\\nover in the swamps, jungles and trenches of Vietnam. Sheen's father,\\nMartin Sheen, had a very similar role in 1979 Best Picture nominee\\n'Apocalypse Now' also about the Vietnam war conflict. Tom Berenger is\\nabsolutely amazing (in his very best screen or television performance)\\nas the ruthless and diabolical, yet clever and calculating SSgt.\\nBarnes. Berenger's acting goes as far as to give you goose bumps in\\ncertain scenes, along with a powerful and unmarred performance by\\nWillem Dafoe (who along with Berenger received an Academy Award\\nnomination, for his turn as the laid-back pot-smoking sergeant, who\\nserves as a father-figure almost to Sheen's character.) Forest Whitaker\\nis good in his role, and John C. McGinley is comical yet cultivated\\nperformance as SSgt. Barnes' lap dog, Kevin Dillon plays an impressive\\npsycho and Johnny Depp is nothing short of sublime in his unfortunately\\nshort screen time. 'Platoon' has very few downsides (I felt it ended a\\nlittle abrupt), but the other outstanding qualities of 'Platoon' pretty\\nmuch make up for it.'Platoon' is an incredible accomplishment, and it's one of the few\\nfilms that actually deserved the Academy Award title of Best Picture.\\nThe film features top-notch acting (especially from Berenger and\\nDafoe), an excellent screenplay, mind-blowing cinematography and\\nvisuals, a powerful musical score, marvelous direction, and a hell of a\\nlot of energy. If you haven't already, view the impressive Vietnam war\\nepic that is 'Platoon'. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #45\\n\",\n",

Towards the end it all\\nbecomes a bit too monotonous, and the message feels like it is pushed a\\nbit far, but the only really significant problem I found in it was that\\nDafoe and Berenger just seem too simply developed as symbols of good\\nand evil.

Our\\ncharacter, the ever-stereotypical wide-eyed \"Naive Private,\" slowly\\ngrows more and more gritty, dark, and harsh with each new experience.\\nWhile it does not have, say, the ridiculously overdone graphics of the\\nmovies that our children watch now, nor a particular scene thrown in\\nfor the ratings-grabbing \"eye candy,\" it truly shows war as the\\nhideous, realistic catastrophe that it is now. The viewer will watch a\\nscene at the start of our movie, with our private staring, disembodied,\\nat the body bags being shipped to America. Eventually the war rears its\\nugly head, and one body becomes 10, 10 becomes 50, 50 becomes a scene\\nin which you cannot see the ground through the napalm.As our private struggles with the ever-elusive \"Charlie,\" or \"VC,\" he\\nis taken under the wing of one of his superiors. As he grows\\nemotionally, and slowly becomes more used to the war, his teacher\\nbecomes more acknowledging of his presence, and indeed treats him as an\\nequal. The echo of this would be his other superior, a battle-ready\\nbruiser who definitely defines the word \"prejudice.\" After the two\\nsergeants fight against each other, the \"teacher\" *PLOT SPOILER*\\nmysteriously dies... Our hero always has a feeling that his other\\nsuperior was behind it, but can\\'t prove it. After a particularly\\ndevastating attack, the private notices his senior, lying on the\\nground, completely untouched, but still acting completely arrogant. Our\\nhero manages to salvage a Vietcong gun (Soviet AK-47 model, to be\\nprecise), and aims it threateningly at the sergeant.\"What are ya gonna DO, kid. Ya ain\\'t gonna shoo-\"...At this point a\\ncomplete round lashes through the man\\'s body, but, like our \"Kid\"\\'s\\nsuperior, no-one will truly know who the killer is.Maybe the best war movies I\\'ve seen, both for the realism its-self, and\\na true portrayal of what can happen when a young man is built on\\nrevenge.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nPlatoon is another great example of a war genre, an Oliver Stone film\\nwhich won an Academy Award for \"best picture\" in 1986. Charlie Sheen,\\n(Pvt. Chris Taylor) plays a na\\xefve young man, whom when entered the\\nbattle discovers there are more enemies than the Viet Cong; there is\\nalso the enemy within himself. This film truly showed what happens in\\nbattle, and sometimes it\\'s not what we expect. Washington post says\\nthat this film is: \"A Triumph! A staggering study of war.\" This film is\\nfilled with action, drama, and of course war. But its primary focus\\nisn\\'t on the war with the Viet Cong, but the war between each other. It\\nteaches you life examples through action, excitement, and death. This\\ndramatic war film tells the truth about what happens in battle. In the\\nfilm Chris (Charlie Sheen) said: \"Somebody once wrote: \\'Hell is the\\nimpossibility of reason.\\' That\\'s what this place feels like. Hell.\"\\nThese two films; \"We Were Soldiers\", and \"Platoon\" show us, the\\nAmerican people, the truth, some may say its wrong, but it must be\\ntold.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI'm a sucker for good war movies but I had not really found a great\\nVietnam film until this. We Were Soldiers (2002) was good but didn't\\ndeal enough with the soldiers. This movie brought alive the atrocities\\nof Vietnam and the horror's America committed in the war.Pvt. Chris Taylor (Carlie Sheen) has just been sent to Vietnam. He is\\nyoung, untrained and afraid. Soon he is mixed in with a company under\\ncommand of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe) and SSgt. Bob Barnes (Tom\\nBerenger) and soon witnesses the horror he will face in the year he is\\nserving. After villages are burned and civilians killed under command\\nof SSgt. Barnes, Pvt. Taylor comes to realize the war they are fighting\\nis with themselves, the message Stone wanted to get across. As the movie progresses, you're confronted with a variety of characters\\nplayed by now famous actors. Johnny Deep, Forest Whitaker, and Kevin\\nDillon just to name a few. This is the best Vietnam film ever made. The\\nmovie is filled with intense and gory action but it still brings its\\npoint forward.Charlie Sheen does the acting of his life along with Berenger and\\nDafoe. Taylor develops with his morals as he sees the horror of war\\nbrought forth and inhumane acts are performed before his very eyes.\\nThere are some very intense scenes involving the execution of a\\nmentally-ill Vietmanese man and a soldier raping a girl in a village. The movie is emotional and powerful. Some very graphic battles and\\nheavy language gave it the 'R' rating but it doesn't take away from\\nthis epic film.Platoon. Starring: Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Forest\\nWhitaker, Keith David, Francesco Quinn, Johnny Deep, and John C.\\nMcGinley.5 out of 5 Stars.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nWith a buttload of war movies out for us movie goers to see, there is\\nrarely any of them that stick out and grab your attention. Sure Saving\\nPrivate Ryan, Apocalypse Now, and Platoon are by far the war movies\\nthat are in the highest regards to us critics, many only have one war\\nmovie that we judge others by. And for me that movie is Platoon. The\\nsetting that stone brings us in when the movie starts mixed with sheens\\nsurprising performance narrating the story sets the mood for which is\\nto come. One of the upsides to this movie is that it really doesn't\\nconcentrate that much on battle scenes as much as blockbusters nowadays\\ndo. The real sense is that of the troops inner struggle instead of the\\nstruggle between us and the vietcong. Berenger and Dafoe give extremely\\ngood performances and i would like to say that Berenger gave one of the\\nbest performances ever in the history of film. I would also like to say\\nthat no matter how many crappy movies sheen is in Platoon will always\\nmake him a star. This film is an absolute masterpiece from beginning to\\nend. Then again i can see why others might not like it, what with the\\nlack of high paid bombings, and shoot outs and whatnot that people\\nmight like from a war movie. However I'm gonna stick to what i think of\\nthe movie and say it is a masterpiece and i think is a must see for\\nanyone that is into movies.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThis film was made about ten years after Oliver Stone wrote the script.\\nBased on his real-life experiences in the Vietnam war, \"Platoon\" tells\\nthe story of young volunteer Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) on his first\\ntour of duty. Enduring the harsh realities of life in the jungle, as\\nwell as the frequent skirmishes with the enemy, Chris comes under the\\ninfluence of two rival sergeants, the decent Sergeant Elias (Willem\\nDafoe) and the brutal Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger).Filmed under brutal conditions in the Philippines, the film is a\\nwell-made study of the war and of it\\'s impact on the men who fought in\\nit. It has often been acclaimed as the most realistic film ever made\\nabout the Vietnam war.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nProbably because I'm not American and certainly because I'm not young,\\nI find it hard to feel much empathy with characters seeped in American\\nstreet culture. In consequence the film left me stone (sorry Ollie)\\ncold sober at the beginning. A bit like the whole of Apocalypse Now.\\nSoldiers swear and get doped, they're incomprehensible, ill breed and\\nugly. When they get blown to smithereens and blood flows, arms come off\\nand characters scream and screech, all I feel is yeah, yeah, yeah, if\\nyou learnt some decent human values maybe I would care that you're\\nsuffering. And then came the sequence in the Vietnamese village and\\nthat really got to me. Outrage and anger, and did they really murder\\nand crush like that, but it's not that simple, were the villagers\\nharbouring the enemy, and so on. It's the best film I've seen on the\\nVietnam war, although I've yet to see Full Metal Jacket. I score 8/10.Anyway ... The reason for me writing a comment is that it occurs to me\\nthat there's a similarity between The Magnificent Seven and Platoon. In\\nthe same way that Seven consolidated the careers of a number of young\\n1960s film actors (Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles\\nBronson, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn), Platoon deepened the careers of\\na number of young 1980s film actors (Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe,\\nCharlie Sheen, John C. McGinley, Johnny Depp). For that reason alone,\\nPlatoon was a milestone (sorry Ollie).\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nSheen played Taylor so well, he was a young curious soldier who was\\nnaive to the reality of war. I don\\'t know why he is being bashed for\\nhis acting. He played the part just the way it should have been played.\\nHe became Chris Taylor just like the other actors became the characters\\nthat they played. Platoon has a brilliant cast in my opinion and\\ndeserves all the praise for being one of the greatest war movies of all\\ntime. It told it straight forward with little \"Hollywood influence\",\\nexcept of course the scene with Willem Dafoe continuing to run from the\\nVC after being shot several times as the helicopter circles above.\\nOverall, a brilliant movie... One of my favorites.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThis film is Oliver Stone's greatest film.

Elias (Willem Dafoe, Excellent) and Sgt.\\nBarnes (Tom Berenger mesmerising as the bad guy).Platoon is a film that does what it sets out to do: Portray the Vietnam\\nWar for what it is: The loss of 58,000 American lives at the expense of\\nGovernment propaganda on Communism.If the ending of this film does not get to you, you've probably got a\\nheart of stone. The film is up there with The Deer Hunter and\\nApocalypse Now as one of the best films about the Vietnam War ever\\nmade.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nBack before Oliver Stone forgot that a good film had to have a good\\nstory he made this one. It remains his best.This is the Vietnam War as I remember it: dangerous, confusing, and\\ndisheartening. I\\'ve known soldiers just like Stone\\'s (he was a\\nfront-line grunt) and situations like he describes. Platoon, for all\\nits artistic license, rings far more true than any other movie about\\nthe Vietnam conflict that I have seen. (The only other films that come\\nclose are \"Casualties of War\" and \"Hamburger Hill.\" \"Apocalypse Now\" is\\ntoo much of a head-trip to really ring true but, in certain scenes, it\\ncaptures the exact feeling of the confused fear of combat.)The entire cast is excellent.Those who haven\\'t seen this film should. It is that good and that\\nimportant.And Stone should have to watch it, too. Maybe it will remind him that\\nhe used to be a capable, if didactic, director and script writer.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThree years ago I made the stupidest comment. Three years ago, I didn't\\nknow how to speak English, or how to really look into movies that much.\\nNow I know much better. Platoon is a great movie, without flaws in\\nacting, directing, pacing or action. The movie depict Vietnam for the\\nhorror it is. Three years ago I put Casualties of War in a second\\nplace, but the truth is that movie is not close to the Deer Hunter,\\nthat I said lack realism. I finally watched Deer Hunter completely, and\\nfor me that's a second place closer than Casualties ever was. I was\\nfoolish enopugh to say Deer Hunter lack realism, but the truth is, it\\ndoes not.

       " u'\\nOliver Stone\\'s very realistic and strong portrayal of the Vietnam war\\nand how a young man (played by Charlie Sheen) and his own platoon (led\\nand played by Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe) are affected by it. Chris\\nTaylor is based on Oliver himself, who was down there and fought and he\\nif any other filmmaker should know about what happened down there while\\nthe ruling elite were rolling their thumbs.The American Rambo-mythology is destroyed in a hell of napalms which\\nare dropped by mistakes or even via order on their own, confusing\\nbattles where no one knows who is shooting at who or why, slaughter on\\ninnocents whose only guilt were being innocents, the fear of the\\nunknown in an alien terrain, conflicts within the own lead, touchings\\nof entire villages, rapes... well, the list can be infinite but most of\\nwhat happened are included in this film with an intensive presence and\\nthanks to Stone\\'s directing feels like you are there fighting the war\\nyourself.

       " u'\\n****SPOILERS**** \"Platoon\" is every bit as powerful an anti-war movie\\nlike \"All Quite on the Western Front\" the film is unlike that 1930\\'s\\nanti-war classic. Where the hero was eager to enter the war and fight\\nand die for his country and felt that the war was justified. The hero\\nin \"Platoon\" Pvt. Chris Taylor, Charlie Sheen, had no doubt at all\\nabout the war that he entered as a green replacement in the battered\\nand bloodied Bravo Company 25th Infantry. Chris felt that the war in\\nVietnam was a necessary evil at best or an unnecessary waste of lives,\\nAmerican and Vietnamese, at worse. Volunteering for combat duty Chris felt that as a more or less\\nprivileged young American he had to pull his own weight and not stay\\nout of the service of his country at it\\'s time of need and dropped out\\nof collage, were he was safe from being drafted for military service,\\nto do that. During his time serving in one of Bravo company\\'s platoons\\nChris realized that not only was he at war with the dreaded and deadly\\nNorth Vietnamese regular soldiers and Vietcong troops and guerrilla\\nfighters he was at war with the men in his own platoon as well as\\nhimself. Graphically violent as well as penetratingly thought-provoking Vietnam\\nWar film by director Oliver Stone that not only shows the war in\\nVietnam but any war for what it really is: Hell On Earth. Were given\\nthe story of the actions of the Bravo Company platoon from the thoughts\\nand writings of young Pvt.Chris Taylor that takes place from the late\\nsummer of 1967 to around the time of the Tet offensive in January to\\nMarch 1968. Which witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting in the war. By the end of the movie Chris\\' platoon was cut to pieces in a series of\\nambushes night attacks and fire fights and finally a major North\\nVietnamese assault that breached Bravo company\\'s forward perimeter in\\nthe Vietnamese jungle. The enemy forces overran and virtually wiped out\\nthe entire infantry company which was saved, in a last act of\\ndesperation, by a USAF bombardment of it\\'s own positions. The film\\nshows that war, no matter how right or wrong it is, dehumanizes and\\nbrutalizes all those involved in it.We see Chris who went from an innocent young man who never fired a shot\\nin anger, if at all, before he entered the US military to a hardened\\nand cold-blooded killer in the less then six months that he was in\\nVietnam. There\\'s also a powerful story between the two sergeants who\\nran the platoon that Chris was in. Sgt. Elias Grodin, Willem DaFoe, and\\nStaff/Sgt. Bob Barnes, Tom Berenger. The two seemed to be more at war\\nwith each other then with the enemy Vietcong and NVR. Sgt. Grodin was\\non the sensitive side who tried to keep at least some of his humanity\\nin light of the madness swirling all around him and was by far the most\\nlikable person in the movie. Staff/Sgt. Barnes was a horribly scared\\npsychotic killer who took no prisoners, military or civilian, and was\\nboth feared and hated by almost everyone in his platoon. As brutal as Staff/Sgt. Barnes was he never the less motivated his men\\nto fight and survive in the savage jungle combat that they encountered\\nall through the film. It was Staff/Sgt. Barnes brutish treatment of\\ninnocent Vietnamese civilians that the platoon came in contact with\\nthat split the two, Barnes & Grodin, up into enemy camps. In one of the most gripping scenes in the movie when Sgt. Grodin was\\nlost in the jungle after an enemy ambush he\\'s spotted by Staff/Sgt.\\nBarnes. You can see by the look in Sgt. Grodin\\'s eyes how happy he is\\nto see him and you get the impression that they\\'ll both make up and\\nbury the hatchet and once again become friends. Yet just by looking in\\nthe crazed stare coming out of Staff/Sgt. Barnes eyes you, and Sgt.\\nGrodin, knew that was not to happen as he put a barrage of slugs into\\nGrodin\\'s chest from his M16.\"Platoon\" is one of those movies about war that really hits the nail on\\nthe head about the horrors of war and that the most righteous of all\\nwars are those wars that are never fought at all.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nMaybe? Well... Vietnam is a personal war, or more to the point, a\\npersonal opinion of that particular war. Like the American Civil War a\\nhundred years earlier historians will never be able to stamp a\\ndefinable image on that conflict. Platoon is a movie about Oliver\\nStone\\'s Vietnam. He may have hit the nail right on the head or he may\\nbe wandering around out in left field somewhere. Only he and the\\nclosest few around him would have a better idea of which image is\\nwhich. The rest of us simply watch the movie and think about it\\nafterward. The combat sequences are without a doubt some of, if not the\\nbest ever shot. This aspect of the film is brutally real. So is the\\ninterplay between the individuals themselves. Through this fascinating\\nmaze of characters and story is woven the moral tale of an everyday All\\nAmerican Boy Next Door who is figuring out that he has made one of the\\nworst mistakes in his life so far. And now he doesn\\'t know if he\\'ll\\neven live long enough to make any more. This thread-morality play-is\\nwhat makes Platoon a very personal movie. A real masterpiece is for\\neveryone. Platoon is not for everyone. A common soldier is presented in\\nan unmistakable image of the Christ. Gut wrenching? Yes. Moving? Yes.\\nReal? That depends a lot on who is watching and taking it all in. One\\nvet says \"There it is!\" Another says \"What a load of crap.\" The only\\nthing the rest of us can do is wonder about it and try to piece second\\nhand facts together. Is this a good war movie? Without a doubt, one of\\nthe best ever. Is it a good movie in general? Definitely! Is it a\\nmasterpiece? I don\\'t know, I wasn\\'t there. I whole heartedly thank all\\nthe poor bastards who were there regardless of personal politics at the\\ntime, and I thank Mr. Stone for both his services to me when he was\\nyoung and in uniform and for becoming such a brilliant and personally\\nhonest film maker. I love this film even though it is difficult for me\\nto watch at times.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nWeird as I am, I'm very interested in history, and the Vietnam in special.\\nBy that, it made this piece a lot more interesting to me than other war\\nmovies - so I just had to see this one with my friend and discuss it\\nafterwards. I found this Oliver Stone piece so tight, scary, dramatic and it\\nsent this huge vibe that stroke me that, this was real - no fake action here\\nladies and gentlemen. I do believe that this movie gives a fair shot of how\\nit might've been being an American trooper down there in those flood deltas,\\nand the way Oliver delivers this story to the viewer it's simply amazing and\\nstunning. No other Vietnam piece can beat this I believe, and the movie\\nreally shakes your brain around a little bit, and afterwards I felt cozy and\\nvery touched. It's just simply a masterpiece!\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nOliver Stone is one of the famous Hollywood-directors that doesn\\'t mean\\nanything to me.  I haven\\'t seen too many of his films, and he\\'s just an\\naverage director to me.  But I have to say that he impressed me with\\n\"Platoon\".  By not holding anything back and basing the film on his own\\nexperiences in Vietnam, he has made one of the best and most realistic\\nwar-movies I\\'ve ever seen, and in my opinion, the best and most important\\nfilm about the Vietnam-war. We follow a young man named Chris Taylor (played by Charlie Sheen) through\\nthe time he serves in the war.  Patriotic, he wants to live up to his father\\n(who served in the World War II) and his grandfather (who served in the\\nWorld War I), but he soon realizes that the war is not a place for him to\\nbe.  As time passes by, he gets deeper into the war and a conflict breaks\\nout between the two lieutenants and veterans of Taylor\\'s platoon: Barnes\\n(played by Tom Berenger) and Elias (played by Willem Dafoe).  The conflict\\nsplits the troop in two.  One part is supporting Elias and the other part\\nsupports Barnes.  This is when Taylor realizes that this war is about more\\nthan just fighting against the enemy.As mentioned, Oliver Stone holds nothing back when he portrays the\\nVietnam-war.  This is the truth about the meaningless hell that young men\\nexperienced, when they were thrown into this war that they never had a\\nchance of winning.  There\\'s one particular scene in the film, where the\\nplatoon invades a local town and some of the soldiers starts killing and\\nhurting innocent people and animals.  This is one of the most dismaying\\nscenes I\\'ve ever seen on film.  It was at this point that the soldiers had\\nto decide what they really felt about the war and what they were doing\\nthere.  This is a good example of Stone\\'s great directing in this film, that\\nmakes everything look very realistic and authentic.  I could complain about\\nthe \"battle\" scenes though, since all the war-films that has been squeezed\\nout of Hollywood lately has more realistic battle-scenes.  But it\\'s still a\\nfact that \"Platoon\" is a way better movie than all the war-films that has\\ncome out after Steven Spielberg\\'s ground-breaking masterpiece \"Saving\\nPrivate Ryan\" in 1998.But the film would\\'ve never been authentic if it didn\\'t have convincing\\nactors, and that\\'s something this film has.  Charlie Sheen does a good role\\nas the young and soft Chris Taylor who becomes a skilful veteran by time. \\nBut the best and most memorable performances in the film is delivered by Tom\\nBerenger and Willem Dafoe. Berenger steals the spotlight in his role as the\\nrough and reckless Lt. Barnes, who becomes a kind of \"bad guy\" as the film\\ngoes on.  Berenger is not only convincing when he delivers the dialog, but\\nhe acts with body-language (especially his eyes) in a great way.  We will\\nprobably never see Berenger as good as he is in this film again.  Willem\\nDafoe is a great actor.  He plays Lt. Elias who is a more calm and rational\\nman who gives the soldiers respectful treatment.  After spending 3 years in\\nthe war he starts taking some serious decisions about the war.  We also get\\nto see some good performances by Keith David, John C. McGinley and Reggie\\nJohnson.\"Platoon\" is one of those films that leaves the viewer with no doubt that\\n\\'War Is Hell!!\\'.  But it still does not manage to avoid a few clich\\xe9s, even\\nthough it\\'s things that I, personally, consider as war-film-clich\\xe9s after\\nwatching many American war-films.  Among all the films I\\'ve seen about the\\nwar in Vietnam, this is the one I rank the highest.  And in the war-genre, I\\nthink Spielberg\\'s earlier mentioned \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998) is the only\\none that tops this great film by Oliver Stone.  If you want to watch a film\\nabout the Americans and the Vietnam-war...watch \"Platoon\"!9.0 out of 10\\n\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nSometimes war isn\\'t just a war pitting two armies together, but a war within\\nthe armies themselves. Platoon is a gut wrenching account of this and we see\\nthat sometimes the enemies in battle can be on the same side. Charlie Sheen\\nplays a private in the Vietnam War who volunteered himself for battle to try\\nand find himself. He quickly comes to notice while he\\'s still wet behind the\\nears that things are not what he expected and that maybe he has bitten off\\nmore than he can chew. Led by two opposing leaders and father figures, he\\nquickly learns the skills he needs to survive and kill.Platoon is an excellent movie that takes a somewhat different approach to\\nthe genre, in my opinion, in that you care more for the characters therein\\nthan in most war movies and find yourself rooting for the characters more\\nthan usual. There are two leaders in the group that are both excellent\\nsoldiers but are at each others\\' throats constantly, and the men must\\neventually pick sides as to who they decide to follow. Tom Berenger plays\\nSergeant Barnes, a man that has been shot 7 times and has served more than\\nhis fair share of time in the war. He has been hardened to the point of\\nlosing almost all moral and is a sick and twisted character that will do\\nwhatever it takes to win the battle. War has become his life. Berenger was\\nborn for this part. Meant to be a tough and scary son of a bitch, you end up\\nbelieving that he is the character depicted in the film. \"Everybody got to\\ndie sometime Red.\" And on the other end we have the equally formidable and\\nseasoned Elias played by Willem Dafoe, the charismatic and sympathetic\\nleader who has served several years in Vietnam and is more of an intelligent\\nand charismatic character. Dafoe was also perfect for his part as well and\\nis easily the most likable character in the entire film. I love his part in\\nthis film, it\\'s just a cool character. Charlie Sheen was also a very good\\nchoice to play the fresh meat grunt who must earn his way, and we see the\\nmovie through his eyes and narration. Platoon is also filled with many other\\nfamiliar faces including Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, and some guys who you\\nwill definitely recognize but may not know them by name. It all comes down\\nto a simply excellent cast with excellent acting that is realistic at the\\nsame time. Acting is not the movie\\'s only strong point. The overall direction by Oliver\\nStone is masterful and educated, Stone having served in the war himself. The\\nfilm includes many of his own experiences which positively gives it more\\ncredibility and realism. Probably his best film to date. Filming in the\\nwilderness has got to be difficult, but what we\\'re treated to is being\\ndropped right into the jungle with the grunts themselves and we get to\\nexperience many of the aspects of the war, including being surrounded by\\ndeath, the insects, the sounds, the marches into unknown territory, the\\nhardships, the weather, etc. The battles are also not to disappoint and keep\\nyour heart pounding and ears ringing. Also, the musical score sets the mood for the film perfectly...haunting\\nsadness. The story is the film\\'s most strong point though. It\\'s a war within a war\\nwith many characters to pull for and to identify with. We get to see all of\\nthe characters and their relationships develop throughout the battles which\\nleads us to the inevitable. What we get is a heart churning epic that I will\\nalways remember.

Also terrific performances from Forest Whitaker, Keith\\nDavid, Kevin Dillon, Reggie Johnson, John C.

Now I know, of\\ncourse,\\nHollywood and the antiwar groupies, Oliver Stone, etc. What else could one\\nexpect to receive the honors.  As for those out there who think Platoon\\nwas\\nsuch a wonderful Vietnam film, I suggest they view \"We Were Soldiers\",\\nstarring Mel Gibson with his portrayal of Lt. Col. Hal Moore, later Gen.\\nHal\\nMoore, in the accurate account of a bloody battle in the la Drang Valley,\\nfrom the book written by Gen Moore. It wasn\\'t necessary to invent heroes\\nor\\nevents there were enough very real ones. Gen. Moore said the film was the\\nmost accurate portrayal of Vietnam and war that he had ever seen.

       " u'\\n\\n*SPOILERS* -- Just in case :)Now that nearly 20 years have passed since Platoon\\'s first screening (can\\nyou believe it?) it seems more like an \\'ok\\' war movie.  \"We Were Soldiers\"\\nis a much more respectful and accurate portrayal of our troops and the VC\\nof\\nthe time (granted, it covers a different time in the war than \"Platoon\"\\ndoes; politics & attitudes were vastly different between the two times, as\\nwell). Like all Stone films, it must be taken with a dose of salt.  Sure\\nthere was plenty of chaos encountered by our soldiers (especially what my\\nrelatives have explained to me and accounts I\\'ve read by respectable\\nindividuals who served honorably), however, a unit like Chris\\'s(Charlie\\nSheen) was simply a work of inspiration and agenda.  No I don\\'t know\\neverything so save your breath, but people need to realize that Chris\\'\\nunit\\nis an art of fiction created to emphasize Stone\\'s agenda with drama.\\nTruly,\\nwhere would the drama be in this film if there weren\\'t the two polar\\noposite\\npersonalities of Barnes and Elias?  Undeniably, the drama is created by\\ntheir opposing attitudes, those that choose to follow them, and those torn\\nbetween them.I cannot think of another war movie that preaches at you like \"Platoon\".\\nOliver Stone, who is considerably anti-war-at-all-costs (perhaps more --\\nheck he\\'s eulogized Castro and Arafat in some recent films at Sundance),\\nserved in Vietnam and chose to make a film that consisted of characters\\ncomprised of a multitude of personalities/attitudes he came across.  And\\nChris, well, that\\'s Oliver himself (so he says in the commentary).  As I\\nsaid before there was no Barnes or Elias, they were figments of\\ninspiration.\\nStone, and many Vietnam critics, fail to mention why were really there.\\nIt\\'s just the same, \"old white men sending young\\nblack/underprivileged/poor\\nmen to go die for them for no particular reason.\"  Um, let\\'s not forget\\nabout communism, and JFK\\'s(our) war against it.  I would like to go into\\nfurther detail to answer some of the uninformed critics on this board, but\\nthat\\'s not what this review is about.  However, I will say, if any one\\ngood\\nthing came from Vietnam, it was the fact that apart from South Vietnam,\\ncommunism spread no further in Southeast Asia, or the rest of the world\\nfor\\nthat matter.  It also dramatically changed the way the U.S. approached\\nwar,\\nused reserves, and used (or have not since used)drafts.I would recommend seeing \"Gardens of Stone\" for a balance after seeing\\nPlatoon.  It deals with the war on the home front and deals with the tough\\nhome front issues of that day.  Directed by Coppola (not his best but\\nstill\\nworth a watch).\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nMost of the Holywood films about Vietnam sets the Vietkongs as evil and\\nshows the heroism of the Americans. The platoon was the first movie I have\\nseen, which was some kind of selfcritism. It's view of war was more\\nobjective and more realistic than other Vietnam movies.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nPlatoon is uncomfortable viewing. The film focuses on Chris Taylor (Charlie\\nSheen) who is a new recruit to Vietnam. In the same way that Chris quickly\\nbecomes used to the stark realities of war, so do the audience. It is a very\\npowerful film and brutally exposes the realities of war. People die in war\\nand the soldiers become familiar with death. Those soldiers that do survive\\nwill not be the same again.Excellent direction for Stone and a good all round cast make for a fine\\nfilm, but it's probably a little too close to the bone to be genuinely\\nenjoyable. 8/10\\n\\n\",\n",

After all, he just finished putting down\\nwhat\\nhe perceived as their naivete.

If I had to\\ndescribe Platoon I would say it is a gut-wrenching experience. The film\\nrealistically shows a platoon of men with their deadly battles against the\\nenemy and themselves during the War. Acting is a big strength in a film. Charlie Sheen is quite believable here\\nas Chris Taylor. Tom Berenger is perfect as the tough-ass Sergeant Barnes.\\nWillem Defoe is also great as Colonel Elias (I think he is a colonel), who\\nis much more understanding than Barnes. Everyone else is quite memorable\\ntoo. The Cinematography is quite stunning in Platoon, probably the best\\ncinematography I have seen in a war film. Stone's direction is perfect. A\\nrarity in war films is a really well-written script, Platoon is extremely\\nwell-written. If you watch you will notice some disturbing scenes that were\\nquite effective to me (The Village Scene). These scenes represent the\\nabsolute horror of what we do to the innocent in war. Although, Platoon's\\nscore is not original (It was in The Elephant Man, 6 years earlier) it is\\neffective, it illustrates the tragedy of war effectively. Platoon is a\\nmasterpiece that will stay with you for awhile. \\n\",\n",

'Tour of duty' was very entertaining to see, but it was a\\nlittle romanticized and unrealistic. In Platoon, you can see that America\\nlost that war because of bad strategy and attitude. The simple-minded, poor\\nAmericans were sent to Vietnam to fight for the rich Americans. They were\\nyoung and no natural born killers so that is why they lost the war.

One thing I can\\'t *stand* about this film is that goofy (and fake-looking)\\nshot of Berenger rearing up like King Kong, silhouetted against the\\nexploding napalm while a Skyraider comes through and \"saves the day.\"  That\\none shot has struck me as false from the first time I saw this.

       " u\"\\n   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***\\nViewed by many Vietnam veterans as the most accurate portrayal of the war,\\nPlatoon is an examplary masterpiece. Platoon is less a war movie than the\\nultimate clash between good and evil, and between those two forces is the\\nmain character Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). Volunteering for the war, not\\ndrafted, the main character quickly learns what he has really signed up\\nfor,\\nand he is definetaly not ready.  Being blown away by the helicopter that\\nsets him down, body bags of all the dead fly away and we see what the\\nfuture\\nholds for our main character and for the entire movie.Platoon presents itself in sections, first being the welcome to Vietnam,\\nmaking friends, and deciding what kind of people you plan to spend your\\ntime\\nwith there. It basically comes down to three groups in Vietnam, the\\nweed-smoking grunts which view the war in a calm manner, the booze\\ndrinking\\nofficers and wannabe officers who do whatever they say, right or wrong,\\nand\\nthe commanders and regular drafted grunts which aren't followed that\\nclosely.Chris chooses to join the pothead group, run by Seargent Elias (Willem\\nDafoe), which treats him kindly and is offenly attacked by the other main\\ngroup, run by Seargent Barnes (Tom Berenger). Under Barnes's brutal\\ncommand\\nChris and his fellow soldiers, who have lost the regard for human life\\nunder\\nBarnes's command, are ordered to search a town of Vietnamese people who\\nare\\ntotally innocent and then burn the entire village, and kill whoever they\\nthink is the enemy. Chris is pulled into Barnes's plans but quickly\\nrealises\\nthat he has made a horrible mistake when Elias brings everyone to their\\nsenses and tells Barnes he will do everything in his power to court\\nmarshall\\nhim. Knowning that he will be shamed and given a discharge from the\\nMarines\\nif Elias gets his way, Barnes shoots Elias in the middle of the jungle\\nduring a firefight.  Chris is sent to find Elias but instead finds Barnes,\\nBarnes tells him Elias was shot by the VC and he is dead.  Soon after the\\nplatoon leaves on choppers only to see from a bird's eye view that Elias,\\nfull of bullet holes, uses his last amount of soul and energy to try to\\nescape from the VC which are simeltaneously shooting him in the back, and\\nthere is nothing the rest of the platoon can do. Chris finally realizes\\nwhat\\nhe has to do to justify Elias's death ,and what he feels, justifies every\\nwrong doing that has been commited in Vietnam by soldier to fellow\\nsoldier.Best movie made in the 1980's and surrely the most realistic look at the\\nwar\\nin Vietnam and the politics that were involved.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThis has by numerous audiences and critics been praised as the best and most\\naccurate portrayal of the Vietnam war at its worst, circa 1968, but much of\\nit I find a little hard to swallow, mainly the way 95% of the enlisted\\n\"grunts\" were all uneducated rednecks or inner-city types, all the humane\\nand saintly types smoked marijuana, and the more lean and mean ones drank\\nbooze. Setting that and the corny narration by Charlie Sheen aside, Oliver\\nStone keeps the political commentary to a minimum (thank God!). Tom Berneger\\nand Willem DaFoe gave great performances, but Charlie Sheen\\'s role as a\\ngreen middle-class college\\ndropout was rather weak in comparison. There were many other underutilized\\nroles to include a WASPish and weak Lieutenant, a nervy Sergeant, and\\ntowering black man that Sheen befriends. The combat sequences were the most\\ngruelling for the time this film was made\\n',\n",

Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger are excellent and Willem\\nDafoe\\nis simply perfect.

       " u'\\nEven after 16 years, \"Platoon\" still is something that is wondrous to\\nbehold. Directed by Oliver Stone, whose personal experiences in the\\nVietnam War were inspirations for the film\\'s script, makes this movie\\nsimply stunning.The four Oscars that this movie won including Best Picture and Best\\nDirector - Oliver Stone just goes to show how amazing this movie is.\\nThe musical score is also one of the best I\\'ve ever heard. Evidently, some people today, don\\'t really think that this movie is as\\ngreat as it used to be. \"Platoon\" over the years has received quite a\\nbit of criticism. For example, some people have attacked the\\npossibility of a civil war ever erupting between two groups of soldiers\\nin a platoon. I agree it is hard to imagine something like that\\nhappening, but that doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t likely. The tension that\\ngrows between Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe) has been\\ngrowing for some time. Barnes believes that the Vietnamese should be\\nwiped off the face of the earth. Elias, who is slightly more\\nhumanitarian, believes that the war is already lost and has deeply\\nimmersed himself in drugs just to escape the grim realities of Vietnam.\\nElias\\' demise at the hands of Barnes goes to show how far down the path\\nhe has gone. Two things to watch out for between these two: Elias\\' in\\nhis final climatic scene and Barnes\\' burning red eyes at the end of the\\nmovie. Another criticism people seem to have with this movie, is its special\\neffects, namely explosions, gunfire, etc. People have attacked the\\neffects because to them, they say that they\\'re dated. Well of course\\nthey are, this movie was made in 1986. Compared to today\\'s war movies\\nsuch as \"Black Hawk Down\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\", it\\'s no wonder\\nthat it will seem out-dated.But the effects in this film were pretty state-of-art when this movie\\nwas released.The performances here are excellent. I\\'ve never seen Tom Berenger or\\nWillem Dafoe in better performances. Of course, this is really Charlie\\nSheen\\'s movie, as this is his best role yet. The supporting\\nperformances from Keith David, Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp, John C.\\nMcGinley and Kevin Dillon are amongst some of their finest performances\\nas well.This is Oliver Stone\\'s finest directorial effort to date. He\\'s never\\nmatched it but has come pretty close especially with \"JFK\" and \"Born on\\nthe Fourth of July\" under his belt. 10/10\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nVietnam, to most other countries, probably has the same meaning as \\'nostril\\'\\nand \\'book\\'--pointless.  But here in America, it is a very sensitive issue\\nthat even today is hard to bring up and still be far in opinion without\\nsounding bias or snobbish.\\n\"Platoon\" takes the uncomfortable situation of being in a foreign, hostile\\ncountry with comrades who can be as psychotic as the enemy and weighing that\\non your conscience for two hours.  It isn\\'t a film where you can sit back,\\nrelax, and watch the fireworks.  You must use your mind to consider the\\nsituations of the unit and \"think with them\" to a degree. The first half,\\nset in 1967, takes us into the war only two years old and rapidly gaining\\nunpopularity at home. By the end, 1968, we come face to face with battle in\\na fashion not jingoistic like John Wayne or gritty like Saving Private Ryan,\\nbut rather a punch in the gut that doesn\\'t try and give you $100 million\\nexplosions and brand-name actors looking clean and cocky.\\nIn all fairness, they are ugly, tired, and their mixed emotions of the\\ngrowing conflict they\\'re embroiled in is eating away at them faster than the\\nleeches.\\nI praise Oliver Stone for not putting \\'glory\\' in the public sense of it into\\nthe film and presenting just how hellish, up-close-and-personal, and\\nunforgiving war can be.  I guess only by serving yourself can you truly\\nunderstand what it\\'s like.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nThis is the first Oliver Stone film that I watched. And I did so only\\nbecause it was directed by him. I found the film disturbing, quite frankly,\\nit\\'s an assault on the senses, visually and audibly. But somehow while in\\nthe middle of it I got the feeling that even when there\\'s continuous firing\\naction most of the time, the message of the film was more against war and\\nthe futility of it than for it. I know that no one expressly states that\\nthey are \"for war\", but wars do take place and have taken place, haven\\'t\\nthey? In one way or the other, the past wars took place because people\\nendowed war with many qualities it just didn\\'t have. Brainwashed by\\npropaganda, they were \"for war\" without even thinking about it. I don\\'t know\\nabout the realism of this film, what I know is, as Sheen\\'s character\\ndiscovers, that most of his fellow soldiers were either under-educated or\\nnot well-off. Usually it\\'s not the rich and the educated who go to war, but\\nthe most deprived of the society. I\\'m glad Stone showed this in the film.\\nHis film, much before Spielberg\\'s vocal anti-war message through \\'Saving\\nPrivate Ryan\\', is a grim warning of the physical, mental and emotional\\ndestruction that a  war causes.      A few minutes into the film and I knew it HAD TO absolutely have a\\nnarrator. Nowhere is the need for the protagonists voice-over more felt than\\nin a film which is a) centered around that one person and b) has him/her in\\nsome situation of conflict, especially War and more especially on foreign\\nsoil. All this is, I think, established in the few initial minutes of the\\nfilm itself. More than anything, narration acts as that one voice talking\\ndirectly at you, usually in retrospect to make sense of all the chaos\\nhappening on screen. Needless to say I was most relieved when Charlie\\nSheen\\'s narration started. Not only did it provide audible relief but it\\nhelped to put forth the theme of the movie. The Cast is superb, especially\\nWillem Dafoe. I couldn\\'t help remembering his role in the World War II film\\n\\'The English Patient\\' in which, though he plays a small role, he\\'s equally\\nbrilliant. The only other film I\\'ve seen Tom Berenger in is \\'Sliver\\' and I\\nmust say, he can be as good a hard-nosed almost psychotic Army officer as he\\ncan, a slick smooth-talking womanizer. He made my flesh creep by his\\nnonchalant attitude towards life, or rather death... I\\'ve not seen any other\\nCharlie Sheen film, partly because I saw him as just another pretty face on\\nscreen. I\\'m glad to eat my words because he\\'s quite a man in this film!\\nEnough said. Those who must be reading this review have likely already seen\\nthe movie and may agree that, though not very palatable, it\\'s quite an\\nexperience...                                   \\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is certainly a war movie.  Is it realistic? I cannot say, as I have\\nnever been in a war.

       " u'\\n\\n*** CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS ***Unlike much of the director\\'s work, Oliver Stone\\'s \"Platoon\" is not politically orientated, at least not to the extent that his later films were. Oh, there\\'s the occasional mention of politics and class division, but for the most part, his film is simply a time capsule of the Vietnam War.It does not claim to hold all the answers to the social, political, or moral\\nissues raised since then. It is nothing more than a record of what it was like there, and that\\'s all it needs to be. I must note that it\\'s more restrained than most of Stone\\'s body of work; it\\'s not that subtle a film on its own, but at least he editorializes less than he usually does.As a combat veteran, he must have realized that the subject matter is best left\\nwithout excessive embellishments or overdramatization.One way that Stone breaks from convention is his portrayal of the day-to-day\\ndrudgery of Vietnam. Much of the protagonist\\'s experiences consist of long,\\nhard marches. He is frequently besieged not by enemy troops, but by exhaustion, humidity, and insect bites. He is given the cold shoulder by the more experienced troops, who adhere to the unwritten rule that the worth of one\\'s life is directly proportional to the length of his stay thus far. As he comes to realize, many of his conflicts will not be with the Viet Cong, but with some of his own comrades...and himself, as well. The conflict has divided American society to such a degree that even our own troops are always at each other\\'s throats. How can we effectively organize a combat unit whose members dislike and mistrust one another, even the commanding officers? This situation will eventually be taken to its worst extremes in later scenes.The internal discord of the infantry is best illustrated by Platoon\\'s most\\nchilling sequence, as the troops run across a village hoarding weapons and food for the enemy. Their leader insists that they are being forced to do so by the Viet Cong, but that does not alleviate the suspicion that they are in league with their foes. The viewer believes him, but that\\'s easy to do when your life is not at stake. The situation deteriorates, almost turning into another My\\nLai-style massacre, as the leader\\'s wife is coldly put to death on the spot. Right after that, we see a weapon being put to the head of a child, bringing us to the realization of the dehumanizing, demoralizing nature of war. Anyone acting in that manner has lost a vital part of himself, a tragedy in its own way.The film takes the effort to give us realistic, well-defined characters. Charlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe evoke our sympathy as kindred spirits; Sheen\\nas the green recruit, Dafoe as the three-year veteran; both as decent people\\ntrying to make the best of a bad situation. Tom Berenger is chilling as their moral foil, a man who\\'s seen too much and experienced too much, to the point where he can no longer distinguish between right and wrong.The supporting cast members all deliver solid performances. \"Platoon\\'s\" only serious flaw is that the voice-over narration seems intrusive at times. Much of the information given is already conveyed--whether explicitly or not--through what\\'s shown onscreen.Towards the very end, there\\'s one odd bit of heavy-handed symbolism that doesn\\'t\\nquite ring true, though I could see what Stone was trying to get across there. Nonetheless, taken as a whole, the film is a valuable historical document, a vital record of a much-debated chapter in American history.\\n\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nVery simply a masterpiece of film making, coupled with\\noutstanding acting. This study of war is an equal of the \\'The Deer\\nHunter\\' and very possibly the supereror of Apolcalypse Now\\'. Very\\ndifferent to both these films, it is a staggering piece of cinema\\nwhich gives the effect of being very real, although this impossible\\nto tell, due to experiences of writer and director Oliver Stone. The\\nscript is very impressive, strenghtened with excellent acting from\\nCharlie Sheen as Chris Taylor who throws himself into the chaos\\nand madness of Vietnam, What is more astounding is the acting\\nof Tom Berenger and William Dafoe in the supporting roles of\\nsergeant Barnes and Elias.\\nIts cinematography portrays a frightening sense of realism,\\n\\'Apocalypse Now\" manipulates the events and lighting to create\\nsome staggering imagery, in \"platoon\\' it appears that someone\\nhas simply put a camera in the middle of the confussion and\\nfilmed what is happening.differing from \\'Apocalypse Now\\', it\\ndoesn\\'t need a extrodinary story to make events interesting and\\nshocking, in a simaler way to \\'The Deer Hunter\\' it creates a feeling\\nof terror and shock over the experiences of every person. Where\\n\\'The Deer Hunter\\' deels with the lives of the soldiers who have no\\nprospects at home, \\'Platoon\\' shows dark and confussed battles\\nfought in a confined,moist and stuffy jungle where soldiers  fight\\namong themselves.\\nTwo hours of brilliant film that will have you thinking of it and the\\nissues it contains for months if not years.\\n',\n",

Unlike Apocalypse Now and Full\\nMetal Jacket, Platoon is not great.  It's okay, maybe a little too\\nhomoerotic for my tastes.  The metaphors are heavy-handed, and the movie\\ndoesn't really jump into the darkness the way I might have hoped.

Only Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET entertained me as\\nmuch as Stone's nam film. Stone recounts the events he experienced in nam,\\nand the acting by the character's is so good that you feel every ounce of\\ntheir pain. Who's side would you choose? Barnes or Elias? It's a real\\nemotional movie, unlike Kubrick's FMJ, and the is right on top of my best\\nVietnam movie list.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nPlatoon was one of the first of many Vietnam War films to show the\\ninjustices and human tragedies that occurred in the jungles of Southeast\\nAsia. This movie won film of the year in 1986 and anyone who objects need to\\nstudy not only the amazing performances by all of the men in the film but\\nalso the storyline that shows us how man's feelings are hardened to the\\npoint of breakdown in War. This movie is a presentation meant for everyone\\nto see what Vietnam Veterans had to go through, done specifically so that\\nthe public embraces them now and does not shun them like the whole nation\\ndid after the war. Like Veterans, anyone who has had some or tremendous\\nemotional difficulty with some of life's obstacles will relate to this film\\nmore than the average person. Platoon provides us with a glimpse into the\\ninsanity of war, the brotherhood of combat, and most importantly the\\ndeterioration of feelings until the point where trust can only be placed in\\nthe man who fights by your side.\\n      \\n        \\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThe beauty of this film for me is that Stone gets across the random\\nconfusion and madness, but also the guilt and savagery and emotional\\nfragility.  Quite an accomplishment in a film which has the overwhelming\\ntheme of contradictions between body and soul.Maybe Stone should have let the action speak for itself rather than have\\nChris give moralising speeches, but thats the only complaint and its a\\nminor\\none.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nit's the only vietnam movie where nothing is glorified at\\nall.\\nyou really feel what it was like to fight in the jungle of vietnam and that\\nwar is no fun at all.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nIn this great film Oliver Stone paints a nice but realistic (and therefore\\nsometimes shocking) picture of what the Vietnam War must have been like in\\nthose days. In a brilliant way, Stone shows us how the Americans were rather\\nfighting amongst themselves than against the \\'real\\' enemy out there. He also\\npoints out that this must have been one of the main reasons why America\\ndidn\\'t win the war. This piece of information is what the film is all about.\\nBesides the actual Vietnam War you can see the development of another\\n\\'personal\\' war that starts with a stupid incident but becomes just as strong\\nand dangerous as the real war.  Good men were killed when they could have\\nbeen saved.In this film, Charlie Sheen is a young soldier who\\'s just started out in\\nVietnam. He\\'s caught between two superiors who (as he said so himself) fight\\nfor the possession of their souls. There\\'s the morally corrupt, merciless\\n\\'killer machine\\' Sgt. Barnes and the much more humane Sgt. Elias who wants\\nto teach his men a sense of compassion and responsibility.\"Platoon\" is a great film, in particular because Oliver Stone creates such a\\nthrilling and realistic atmosphere throughout the entire picture. The\\ncamera-work is great but unusual as Stone becomes a part of his own film by\\nacting as if he were one of those soldiers.  This technique is often used to\\ncreate a rather claustrophobic and panicky atmosphere and it\\'s best-known as\\n\\'subjective camera shots\\'. Most of the film takes place in the jungle, but this so-called lack of\\nvariation is never boring. The scenes in the jungle are really\\nnerve-wracking, as you never know what could happen next.  One moment you\\nhave piece and quiet where you can literally hear the birds singing; it\\'s\\nalmost as if the war has suddenly ended ... and then there\\'s the\\near-deafening noise of gunfire and grenades which, to anyone\\'s surprise,\\nimmediately follows in the scene hereafter.Because of an interesting story with great acting performances, Oliver Stone\\nmanages to keep you emotionally involved for the whole time being.  Both Tom\\nBerenger and Willem Dafoe do a good job, but the most notable performance\\ncomes from Charlie Sheen.  Interesting to know is that Charlie Sheen\\'s\\nfather Martin has also starred in a Vietnam movie many years\\nago.Personally, I think \"Platoon\" is a very good film that gives the viewer an\\ninsightful representation of how the Americans may have lost the Vietnam\\nWar.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\n\"Platoon\" is one of many Vietnam war movies. It\\'s also, in my opinion, one\\nof the very best, to run alongside \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Full Metal Jacket\".\"Platoon\" tells the story of a platoon (funny that) of Vietnam soldiers.\\nIt\\'s mainly told through the eyes of young new recruit Chris (Charlie Sheen)\\nand we hear this thoughts and meditations on what happens. Central to the\\nstory-line is the brutal treatment of a group of Vietnamese villagers at the\\nhands of the platoon and how the group reacts to the execution of one\\nvillager by Officer Barnes (Tom Berenger) - one half siding with Barnes and\\nthe other with Elias (William Dafoe). The story becomes quite brutal (in a\\ndark fashion - not a bad one) and Stone ably handles this with consistent\\nuse of rain and darkness. The battles are deftly handled and reflect the\\nchaos and confusion they find themselves in (noticeable particularly in the\\nfinal battle). There is a constant struggle going on between the dark side\\nand the light side - without and with morales - reflected in the characters\\nof Barnes and Elias which is very interesting. Th characters also have depth\\nhere - we do end up caring for them and they are drawn in a far superior\\nfashion to many war movies where characterization is second to pretty\\neffects (\"Black Hawk Down\" springs to mind).\"Platoon\" is certainly one of the best war movies I\\'ve seen as it handles\\nmultiple elements effectively - the people and the action, as well as issues\\nof morality. It looks and feels good. I recommend this movie to all,\\nespecially when those inferior features like \"Black Hawk Down\" are currently\\ngetting (somewhat unwarranted) praise from this site\\'s reviewers.\\n8/10.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nSPOILERSThis sits right behind `The Godfather' as my all time favorite movie. \\nActually I have probably watched this film more times than any other.  A\\nfriend and I had seen this so many times that if one of us quoted a line\\nfrom it the other would answer with the next part of the script and then we\\nwould go on for about 15 minutes verbatim from the dialogue (much to the\\nannoyance of anyone around us).Though I've never been in combat, I have been in the Army for 17 years and I\\nhave a feeling (from knowing my fellow soldiers like I do) that this movie\\nis accurate in portraying combat and the life of the grunt in Vietnam.  And\\nif it is this verite that compels the film, it the acting that keeps it\\nfocused.  The supporting cast is tight and the three main players (Sheen,\\nBerenger and Dafoe) are outstanding.  Stone really inspired these men and\\nbrought out indelible performances.The intensity of this work is severe.  It is commensurate with a good horror\\nfilm that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but in this case the horror is\\nall too real.  Three scenes are particularly nonplusing: the playing of\\n`Tracks of My Tears' in the middle of the film as a clear point in which to\\ndelineate the hopelessness of the soldiers; the fulminating village scene\\nculminating in Barnes with the gun to the little girls head and the\\ndisconcerted face of Chris as he strains with emotion, wanting to say\\nsomething; and the incomparable tableau of Elias' death, arms outstretched\\nto the sky as the chopper flies by.  That scene has affected me like few\\nscenes ever have, and it always takes me a few minutes to recover from it. \\nIt is one of the most powerful film moments I have ever seen. And Stone's\\nchoice of `Aidiago For Strings' for the background music was very\\nperceptive.The only question I have about the movie is the ending.  I can't praise it\\nor condemn it.  I suppose that it is realistic, but it seems to lessen the\\nhumanity of Chris especially considering his final words about going from\\nthis point to make a better world.  It just seems like such a great film\\ndeserved a better ending but, as I cannot come up with one myself, I'll keep\\nmy criticism low.  A quick side note: I met Corey Glover who played `Francis' (the guy who\\nstabs himself in the leg at the end in order to go home) in Stuttgart\\nGermany.  He was the lead singer for the band `Living Colour' (they had a\\nhit with the song `Cult of Personality') and they were playing a club there.\\n He was very cordial and talkative.  I didn't realize at the time that he\\nhad even been in the film until I watched it for a second time on video and\\nnoticed his name. \\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\n\\tDirector-writer Oliver Stone, who was a Vietnam vet, began his Vietnam\\ntrilogy with \"Platoon\".  Most of the film was almost based on his\\nexperiences as a soldier.  The film would win numerous awards, including the\\nBest Picture and Best Director Academy Awards..\\n\\tThe film tells a story of Chris Taylor, played by Charlie Sheen.  His\\nplatoon is led by two sergeants.  One who goes around and kills villagers\\nwithout being stopped(Tom Berenger).  The other is the complete\\nopposite(Willem Dafoe).  The soldiers have to choose sides between\\ncommanding officers.  \\n\\tMuch of the fighting is very violent.  In my opinion, \"Platoon\" is my\\nfavorite film depicting the conflict in Vietnam.  This is my fifth favorite\\nwar film and is in my top twenty-five list of the greatest films ever.  A\\ntour de force for Stone in many ways.  This is a war film to be treasured\\nfor a long time.  P.S., look for Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards who\\nmakes eye contact with Sheen at the beginning.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nFor those of you who gave this movie less than an eight, you should be\\nashamed of yourselves. Platoon is one of the all time great war movies, as\\nwell as an excellent movie period.  The acting is nearly impeccable, and the\\nstory and action is as good as any other film. If you vote for this film\\nwithout having actually seen it, then you  should smack yourself in the\\nface, but then again that would be the only plausible reason for not giving\\nthis film an 8,9, or 10.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nAfter all the fame and glory that this film has received, and the fact that\\nI had already seen `Born on the Fourth of July', with its due positive\\nreflections, I only managed to see `Platoon' very recently.Whereas there is no argument as to whether Stone is an excellent director,\\nor that the cinematography is spot on and the principal actors \\x96 especially\\nCharlie Sheen \\x96 play their r\\xf4les acceptably well, this bellicous drama more\\nor less redeems itself as being a historical documentary rather than a film\\nmade for entertainment in the cinema \\x96 or on TV. One tends to tire of so\\nmany war films; however Oliver Stone does strike a chord, albeit only in a\\nremorseful sense, and we have to remember that the cinema must also reflect\\nhuman conditions at any given moment. Unfortunately Viet Nam's war existed,\\nand somebody had to tell it. In the space of three years Stone turned from a\\nwar story-teller to a definite anti-war activist between these two films\\nmentioned. I would rather like to see his `Heaven & Earth' (1993) in order\\nto see where his thinking has led.Stone does not stop short of showing all the ugliness and horror of war: he\\npositively bombards us with it. There is nothing subtle. Indeed, it seems\\nthat such ingredients, together with assassinations and attempted murders of\\npresidents, are the staple diet of his fetishness. `Platoon' is a visual\\nimpact that simply leaves you reeling; but from there to considering it a\\n`great film' there is a great void.Far more useful as a deployment of evoked sympathies over the Viet Nam war\\nis `Casualties of War', directed by Brian de Palma and with Thuy Thu Le's \\nsoul-destroying peasant girl. As far as the war in Viet Nam and films related to it are concerned, I have\\nhad enough. Hopefully we will not, in years to come, get more of this\\nmedicine in the form of Afghanistan \\x85\\x85.. bin Laden \\x85\\x85.

       " u\"\\n\\nThis film is timeless and describes the reality of the Vietnam war better\\nthan any other. This film is not hollywood and it is not surreal. It is\\nreality. The film does try to be black and white and is not afraid to show\\nthe complexities facing fighting men in Vietnam. However, the real greatness\\nof this film is in the gritty realism of the characters. Stone gathered a\\ngreat and diverse collection of actors. Each character well developed and\\nunique. In deed, the viewers are allowed to look at these characters and\\nchoose which one best represents them and in that, perhaps sees how they\\nmight have done in Vietnam. Charlie Sheen's character is innocence, heading\\nfor war. When he arrives in Vietnam, he must make the choice of what kind of\\nsoldier he will be. Will he emulate Sargent Barnes, a hardcore lifer that\\nbelieves in killing them all and staying alive? Or will Sheen's character\\nchoose to join the souls under Sargent Elias, a compassionate veteran, who\\nrealizes that American soldiers are still human beings and should act as\\nsuch. The greatness of this film, is that the choice is not cut and dry.\\nBarnes represents the frustration of many grunts in Vietnam. The frustration\\nof seeing many friends die and not knowing who your enemy is. The\\nfrustration of being placed in a foreign land and not knowing how to win.\\nMany young men see Barnes as their savior, the man that will kill the enemy\\nand keep them alive. Although Barnes is evil, one can see why men would be\\nattracted to him. However, for many, Barnes is the worst of what war turns\\npeople into. These optimists cling to their humanity and to Elias, a\\nChrist-like figure that attempts to keep the souls of those young soldiers\\npure. This film takes the viewer to Vietnam and puts them in the jungle. It\\nshows us why we would never ever want to be there. It shows us many\\ndifferent and diverse characters, some we relate with, others that we abhor.\\nIt shows why Vietnam was unique and why we were not able to win there. It is\\nnot a fun film to watch, but war is never fun. Great film that comes as\\nclose to perfection as any film can. Great performance and great direction.\\nSee it!\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nThis was such an excellent movie. Extremely well acted with a deep plot that\\nyou really get into.

I've sat through many war films\\nthat claimed to be great,with Hamburger Hill (sad acting),Full Metal Jacket\\n(not bad,but seemed more like two separate stories and dragged on at\\ntimes),Thin Red Line (great potential but very boring) and Saving Private\\nRyan (which was good but was certainly no Platoon). Realizing what era\\nVietnam was during,may help some viewers see that yes drugs were around and\\nused (giving what pressure and confusion amassed during that time period)\\nand the 'unknown enemy' syndrome in 'Nam,you can see how a young soldier\\nwould 'lose it' and end up killing innocents;not knowing the difference.\\nAnyone who denies these things needs a wake up call. Not that I condone\\nthem! But I don't doubt that they have happened and I see no reason why they\\nshouldn't be in the film;as some reviewers complained about.  My single complaint about the movie at all would have to be that I wish\\nStone had used more of Johnny Depp in the film,as I think he is not only a\\ngreat actor,but very under-rated. 9/10\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nUnlike the more ponderous APOCALYPSE NOW, this film is more concise in\\nrevealing the horror of war. Oliver Stone uses two allusions to get his\\npoint across. One is Sergeant Barnes as \"our Captain Ahab\" leading the\\nplatoon on a doomed mission into the hell of the wartime jungle. The other\\nis Sergeant Elias as a Christ figure.The battle is for the soul of the naive Chris Taylor. Chris goes through the\\nclassic American journey of initiation into evil. The events are harrowing\\nand the film leaves the viewer stunned by the savagery that human being can\\ncreate. The film can also leave the viewer enlightened about the potential\\nfor goodness in human beings.\\n',\n",

This movie portrayed\\nU.S. soldiers as dope heads, thugs and murderers.  I couldn't care less\\nabout Mr. Stone's opinion of the military or of the Vietnam War.  If you are\\ngoing to tell a story, tell it right.  The whole story was outrageous:  SSG\\nBarnes kills a native villager; the platoon burns the village.  SSG Barnes\\nkills SGT Elias because he thinks he is going to rat him out.  Then Chris\\nkills a wounded Barnes for no apparent reason.  Please, give me a break!

       " u'\\n\\nOne of the reasons why this is a great movie,is because Oliver Stone\\ndirected it,and the fact that almost all of his movies are\\ngreat.This movie describes the Vietnam war much better than other movies in the\\nway that we see everything that happens to a young boy (Charlie Sheen),from\\nthe day he gets there and till he leaves.\\nIt shows how innocent people are killed and that the americans are wiling to\\ndo everything to win the war.\\nThe american generals send their men into a certain death.The battles scenes are very realistic and explicit and this movie is not for\\npeople who cant handle violence.This movie has so many famous actors that it was doomed to be a hit.Among\\nthe actors are,Tom Berenger,Willem Dafoe,Charlie Sheen,Forest\\nWhitaker,Francesco Quinn,John C.

       " u'\\n\\nI put off seeing this film, despite being an Oliver Stone fan, after getting\\nmore than my fill of Vietnam war movies. 15 years after its theatrical\\nrelease, I had the chance to catch it for the first time on the special\\nedition DVD (an excellent disc, btw).My reaction?This film has aged very poorly. Either that or it wasn\\'t much good to begin\\nwith. I noticed that almost all the situations are hackneyed (young,\\ninnocent solider getting killed without any reason, the Southern \"good old\\nboys\" as war mongers, the immoral murder of simple villagers, etc).  The\\ndialogue is flat. Charlie Sheen is, as always, absolutely horrible. It is\\nembarassing to see him up on the screen with such talented actors as Tom\\nBerenger and Willem Dafoe. He is just absolutely out of his league. Johnny\\nDepp is given a tiny supporting role when Stone should have given him the\\nSheen part...Depp being the (much) superior actor.  In fact, we spend way\\ntoo much time with Sheen and not enough with Forrest Whitaker, Depp, and\\nKeith David.As others have commented, this isn\\'t a narrative but a collection of\\nindividual scenarios that Stone has put together. Unfortunately, most of\\nthese scene are present in other films and done much better (Full Metal\\nJacket).The lines that Stone draws between the \"good guys\" and the \"bad guys\" is\\nabsolutely ridiculous: the bad guys are generally racist Southerners and the\\ngood guys are enlightened potheads. They\\'re about as two dimensional as\\nyou\\'d expect from a war movie.If you want to see a great war movie, skip this one. Full Metal Jacket and\\nThe Thin Red Line are more raw and engaging than this film will ever be.  To\\nbe perfectly honest, the documentary included on the special edition DVD is\\nmuch, much more interesting than the movie itself.One final note: Tom Berenger holds his own against Dafoe, Whitaker, and\\nDepp. I am very curious as to why his career never took off as those others\\ndid. He controls every scene he is in and this viewer was hanging on every\\nline that he delievered.  What a shame he is stuck doing garbage like \"The\\nSubstitute\"....\\n',\n",

Pretty much\\nautobiographical, PLATOON stars Charlie Sheen as a recruit who, upon\\nentering country, is put into a rag-tag platoon patrolling the Central\\nHighlands of Vietnam during the fall of 1967.  After some truly horrific\\nfirst combat scenes, Sheen finally gets his bearings but then realizes the\\ntragic mistake he made in joining to fight.  Soon, he becomes involved in an\\ninter-platoon war between his two sergeants--Barnes (Tom Berenger), the\\npersonification of Death and Reality; and Elias (Willem Dafoe), the\\npersonification of Humanity.In the end, we come to the realization that the enemy was always staring us\\nin the face; but instead of being Oriental or communist, that face was\\nAmerican.  It was us against ourselves, as Sheen points out in his closing\\nnarration.  Oliver Stone must be commended for portraying this misbegotten\\nwar for what it was: the death of a nation's innocence where we all found\\nout just how imperfect we could really be.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nIt is odd, isn\\'t it, that the most realistic war movie about Vietnam was\\nmade by Oliver Stone. Stone gave us his \"theory\" movies about the presidency\\nof Richard Nixon and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. But it is\\n\"Platoon\" that most vividly shows us the reality of the Vietnam War. It is\\nbased on Stone\\'s personal experience and that perhaps is why it was so much\\neasier to stick to the facts in this account, rather than try to fill in\\nhuge gaps with mere guesses as he did in \"Nixon\" and \"JFK\". (Just so you\\nwill know, I like both of those films but too many people view them as\\nGospel truth rather than one man\\'s take on what MIGHT possibly have\\nhappened. In Platoon we are carried through a private\\'s personal tour of duty from\\nstart to finish. His name is Chris and his story is based loosely on the\\ndirector\\'s own experiences. Chris and his Platoon are soon torn between two\\npoints of view between conflicting leaders. Sgt. Barnes is tied to the code\\nof following the orders of superiors. Barnes doesn\\'t believe in questioning\\n(as long as he is not the one doing it), much less out and out not obeying\\norders from a superior officer. That is the machine and as Barnes says \"if\\nthe machine breaks down we break down.\" Sgt. Elias is more of a diplomat and\\nsteps in when Barnes takes things into his own hands and disobeys the rules\\nof humanity. Barnes is still intent on winning the war. Elias has given up\\nhope and sees his job as trying to get out alive and take as many as he can\\nfrom his Platoon back home with him. Killing for survival is allowed, but\\nkilling for revenge or for advantage is no longer a part of the war for\\nhim.Chris ultimately has to choose which one of these voices he will listen to.\\nThere are times when Chris seems very much in agreement with Barnes and\\nthere are other times when Elias shines through his actions. It is this\\nconflict for Chris\\' soul that drives this film to its final climax. Who\\nChris ultimately sides with may not even be clearly answered. Remember\\nactions speak louder than words. Aside from the characters themselves Platoon clearly demonstrates that most\\nAmericans who died in Vietnam were viewed as expendable human beings whose\\nworth back home was not much. The American government sent these men over\\nthere to fight the government\\'s war. Of course if you were in college you\\ndidn\\'t have to fight and where do you think the government official\\'s kids\\nwere? Stone does a great job in not letting us know exactly what the soldiers were\\ntrying to accomplish. This took away our ability to see some ultimate goal\\nin this mishmash of gunfire and explosives. Instead we are allowed to\\nunderstand the fear of moving in one direction or another. Platoon does not\\nglorify war in the least, but let\\'s us view the hell that it is.There are some who went to Vietnam who did not like this movie because it\\nshows alot of the ugliness of the American soldier\\'s relationship with\\nVietnamese civilians. I think it is safe to say that village annihilation\\ndid not happen all the time. I do think it happened more than we would like\\nto admit. Were innocent people killed in Vietnam? Yes. Were children and\\nwomen killed by inhumane American soldiers? Yes. Give Stone credit for not\\ntrying to sugar coat this at all, but presenting it with all its ugliness.\\nIf anything this movie has promoted healing as many of us who did not serve\\ncan at least have some way of understanding the hell that the vets went\\nthrough. This picture deserved every award and accolade it got and is a must for\\nanyone who is interested in knowing more about Vietnam. If you liked this\\nfilm I highly recommend \"Born on the Fourth of July\", Stone\\'s work that\\ndeals with the return from Vietnam. \\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\n\"Apocalypse Now\" and \"The Deer Hunter\" come close, but \"Platoon\" is the best\\nVietnam war movie made bar none.  Oliver Stone\\'s supposedly autobiographical\\naccount of two sergeants, Elias (Willem Dafoe) and Barnes (Tom Berenger),\\nwho fight over seemingly everything, is moving and has many memorable scenes\\nthroughout the movie.  Charlie Sheen is a man who foolishly offers to join\\nthe army without being drafted and pays dearly for his mistake.  Sheen,\\nDafoe, Berenger, and many others give great performances that give the movie\\na horrific feel.  If you look closely, you can actually see Oliver Stone\\nmake a cameo near the end of the film as a general that gets blown up by a\\nkamikaze Vietcong Soldier with a bomb on his back.  Very good film -\\n10/10.\\n',\n",
       " u'Add another review',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nI think this is an important war-movie because the essential elements of the\\nstory are historically and personally important and because the many details\\n(art-direction) are historically accurate.  Apocalypse Now and Catch-22 (MY\\nsingle favourite film of all time) are still ahead of Platoon by a long\\nshot, because they portray the horrors and insanity of war in a much more\\nhuman AND horrifying way, and don't concern themselves with supposed\\nrealism.So, definitely not the best war-movie, but absolutely worth\\nseeing/renting/buying.  It is a movie about supposed experiences of one man\\nand is actually a compilation (as many war-movies) of experiences of\\ndifferent people (mostly Stone's own though).  The cinematography by Robert\\nRichardson (Casino, Salvador) is great, but the acting ('method-directed' !)\\nis not brilliant and the whole is made digestible and cliche; it has not\\nbecome cliche after Platoon-wannabee-movies, but it was already cliche when\\nit was released in 1986.  Platoon feels synthetic, because it is too\\npicturesque and the music drowns out the emotions and therefore destroys\\nsome of the realism, where the music in Apocalypse Now (Coppola, 1979)\\npoetically stresses the horrors and Catch-22 (Nichols, 1970) doesn't need\\nmusic at all.  Oliver Stone made it digestible when he wanted to show\\nhorrifying experiences.  That's its (commercial) power and its\\nweakness.Platoon succeeded however, to reach a VERY large audience.  That couldn't be\\nsaid of the other two at time of release (don't count the IMDb votes: they\\ndon't represent box-office success).  So every war-movie is effective in a\\nway, if only for the director to free himself from terrible memories. \\nPlatoon is in that way perhaps similar to 'The Big Red One' (Fuller, 1980),\\nwhich is from another perspective very off-beat.  Platoon simply came a\\nlittle bit too late.  Full Metal Jacket (Kubrick, 1987) a little bit more. \\nNot to speak of 'Born on the first of July' (1989).But after all I'm the kind of guy who thinks Saving Private Ryan (1997) was\\na terrible waste of time, apart from Janusz Kaminski's (Schindler's List,\\nA.I.) great contribution.  Finally, 'Wild Palms' (1993, miniseries) is\\nStone's most interesting project so far, unfortunately not directed by\\nhimself.9/10\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\n Platoon is my favorite war movie and my 6th favorite movie. Oliver Stone\\nhas created the perfect surrounding for frightened and inexperienced\\nsoldiers. Charlie Sheen has not been in a better movie since. I don't know what it\\nwas like in Vietnam, and I'm sure that the terror of all those hundreds of\\nthousands of soldiers would not be able to compare to any movie, but I think\\nPlatoon came as close as any movie could get. Willem Defoe dose a great job as Sergeant Elias, but Tom Berenger stole the\\nshow as the cold Sergeant Barnes.  The destruction of the small village was almost too hard to watch, and the\\nfinal battle was intense as well as magnificent. Platoon deserves all the\\ncredit it has gotten over the years, and it will become a movie classic.\\n10/10\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nFlat-out harrowing and very unsincere war epic, director Oliver Stone\\nused his own experience in the battle to create this movie and I really\\nadmire for doing just that.  What I also admire in the film is the\\nfirst-rate cast, headed by Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Willem\\nDafoe.The film is seen and told through the eyes of Chris (Sheen), a college\\ndropout who enters the Airborne Division and ultimately gets more than he\\nbargained for.Chris becomes a close friend to the patron saint-like SGT. Elias\\n(Dafoe),\\nwhile he despises the scar-faced and bitter Barnes (Berenger), the other\\nSGT. who is a higher ranking officer in the company.  The hatred and\\ndisrespect that Barnes and Elias show toward each other eventually\\nconsumes\\neverybody in both units.Stone is very smart in setting up most of the shootouts and he does it\\nso\\nwhere any G.I. goes to for cover, they're always in danger of being hit by\\nanything (enemy or friendly fire, a mortar or long-range shell).  To\\nsurvive\\na single battle in this war without being shot or witnessing some\\ngod-awful\\nsight like seeing a friend dying was very common.  That I can\\nunderstand.The performances given here are than memorable, it leaves an\\neverlasting\\n(and paralyzing) effect on one.  One example would seeing the reaction on\\nChris's face when he notices that Elias is still on the ground and being\\nshot at by several V.C..What Oliver Stone has made here is a classic and I was satisfied\\nalthough\\nDafoe didn't get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar is a real mystery.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis 'staggering study of war', this accurate picture of the Vietnam war,\\nthis brilliantly acted and powerful film rightly won best picture of 1986.\\nThe film is based on Oliver Stone's own experiences in the Vietnam war, and\\nthis makes the film as real as an actual true story. The story is seen\\nthrough the eyes of Chris Taylor, a young middle class volunteer who was at\\nthe begining of the film, unaware of the things he would go through. Chris\\nTaylor joined the 'Grunts' in this gruelling war to follow the family\\ntradition, his Grandfather in the First world war and his Father in the\\nSecond, but he quickly realised that there was no such thing as fighting\\nand\\ndying with honour, just fighting and dying with pain and fear. He had to\\nwatch war crimes that he could not stop nor ignor. While Tom Berenger and\\nWillem Dafoe provide stunning performances, the suporting cast show\\nchilling\\ncruelty not only to each other but primarily to the Vietnamese villagers.\\nIn\\na war of this kind the tagline is very true, 'The first casualty of war is\\ninnocence'. I also strongly respect people who realise that the Americans\\nweren't always the heros. In this film, no-one was a hero, both sides\\ncomitted terrible atrocities and had their innocence lost. In my opinion,\\nOliver Stone's 'Platoon' is quite simply one of the greatest war films ever\\nmade.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nLet's start before I see this movie I have seen others movies about\\nVietnam like The Deer Hunter,Casualties Of War,Apocalypse Now....etc from\\nthe bunch the best was Apocalypse Now and in a distant second was\\nCasualties\\nOf War because The Deer Hunter was good but it has no reality.Then I see\\nthis movie about Vietnam called Platoon and this was one of the best,I like\\neverything the realism,the action,the drama,the suspense between who was to\\nbe killed everything now I had Apocalypse Now and Platoon in a tied number\\none.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI was dismayed to see that Saving Private Ryan is way up on the IMDB top 250\\nfilms list.  Platoon is in a different league and belongs way above that\\npiece of schmaltz.  There are 3 awesome Vietnam films in my opinion -\\nPlatoon, The Killing Fields and The Deer Hunter.  All show different aspects\\nof that terrible conflict.  Platoon puts across what it must have been like to be an American GI, living\\none day at a time, not knowing what on earth you are fighting for. \\nBerenger, Sheen and Dafoe make very effective leading players and Oliver\\nStone directs with an expert hand.Brilliant.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is a marvellously made movie. I never believed how horribly the\\nAmericans acted during the Vietnam War.

He's a great\\ndirector.-MICHAL\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nPure genius.  Those are two words to describe Oliver Stone's best work,\\nPlatoon.  This movie captured the heart of the young soldiers and\\nbattle-scarred veterans of the most tragic war in the history of the USA.\\nTom Berenger gives the performance of a lifetime opposite Willem Defoe, who\\nby far also gives an Oscar-worthy performance.  Combined with superb\\ndirection of the dark jungles of Vietnam, this movie takes viewers into the\\nworld of that war, and illustrates the grittiness and determination (along\\nwith luck) it took to survive while showing the internal struggles of all\\nthe men.

       " u'\\nI only have one word for this title...Magnificent. I fell in love with\\nPlatoon from the first time I saw it. It became one of my favorite\\nfilms of all time. The acting, the story, the setting, all well done\\nwith realistic features. I connected with every single character. I\\nfelt empathy for the men at war. I was able to see how each character\\nwas feeling from their facial expression. Truly, Truly stupendous\\nmovie.ACTING: Wow, the acting was incredible especially from Willem Dafoe,\\nCharlie Sheen, and Tom Berenger. Dafoe with his soft side character who\\nactually cares for his men blew away. Sheen as the naive person was\\nfunny I thought. The star of the show for me was Berenger as the\\ndarkest character, Barnes. Berenger portrays him with such power that\\nit makes you want to hate him. Amazing performances by each of these\\nactors.STORY: The story is just marvelous but also sad. It devastating to see\\nhow much war can truly change someone. It is also devastating to see\\nhow morality changes with some of these men. It is a truly epic battle\\nbetween good and evil.This is a must see before you die film!!\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nA terrific film from a filmmaker long absent from his art, this movie\\nis a frightening and challenging look into the battlefield operations\\nof Vietnam. Platoon is a fine work from a great screenwriter. You can almost smell the rotting jungle, and the cinematography is\\ngreat. The fine cast excels under Stone's direction. IMHO, it may be\\nbetter than Full Metal Jacket. I loved the nighttime battle scenes and the banter between the grunts.\\nIt is almost as if Stone was there (oh, he was). Some of it is rather unbelievable and melodramatic, but it is art. Also, the soundtrack is epic!\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nMy movie choice was one of my favorites of all time, Platoon, it is an\\nacademy award-winning movie about Vietnam and how a young man from a\\nwealthy family volunteers for duty and finds himself fighting for not\\nonly for his life but lives of his platoon members as well. Chris\\nTaylor played by Charlie Sheen narrates his story through his\\nexperiences that he and his platoon encounter with the North Vietnamese\\nand the Viet Cong that eventually leads to a series of events both\\nphysically and emotionally demanding. Other actors that were involved\\nin this film, Tom Berenger (Sgt, Barnes), a true veteran in the field\\nand an emotionally strong, violent leader that tries to control the\\naction at all times against his fellow enlisted members. Next, William\\nDefoe (Sgt. Elias), also a true veteran but with a softer more\\nunderstanding view of the war that after an accidental murder due to\\nthe stresses of combat creates tension between him and Sgt. Barnes.\\nBoth have major roles in the film and display a good guy bad guy\\nrelationship with one another. It reminds me of a movie I have not seen\\nin a while by the name of \"The Siege Of Fire Base Gloria\" another\\nVietnam movie that has similar concepts as Platoon. Oliver Stone, one\\nof the best directors in the business, with this movie captures the\\nintense drama, and experiences that he himself came to realize as a\\nyoung Vietnam soldier. It won Oscars for sound, best director, picture,\\nfilm editing, and several others. This movie involves the most\\nincredible sounds and emotions that I have ever experienced as a movie\\nwatcher. Oliver Stone creates sounds that subjectively place the actor\\nwith the experience. Through emotional transitional elements of\\nfirefights and explosions he creates an on the edge of your seat\\nfeeling that keeps the action real from beginning to end.There were so many different types of sounds and physical emotions it\\nis difficult to choose just one. Some of the specialized purposes of\\nsound were the beginning of the movie with the first musical score by,\\nVancouver Symphony Orchestra-Adagio for Strings (The 80\\'s rewind,\\n2008), which if you have never seen this movie it would make no sense\\nto you but to experience it is the most moving piece of music I have\\never heard. It transforms your very soul into the movie right from the\\nstart and plays throughout the movie to transition the most emotional\\nparts of the film. One thing that I will tell you about this film is\\nabout the expansion and compression of time in slow motion. The most\\nintensified, ironic, and emotional part of this type of compression\\ndisplayed during the death of Sergeant Elias (William Defoe) by far one\\nof the best scenes in any war movie ever made. With many movies out\\nthere today Platoon gives you the most realistic experience, and an\\nall-star cast of characters that have moved on to become movie icons in\\nthe industry. A must see movie to add to your movie night experience\\nand collection.\\n',\n",

'Platoon' is a\\nsemi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat, Stone\\nhad the courage to re-set all the violence, the gore, the back-stabbing\\nin 'Platoon'. 'Platoon' is about living the war within, with the devil\\ninside you. Stone surpassed himself so much, that I can't recollect any\\nother classic this legend has made.When I say that 'Platoon' is cult classic, I mean it in all means. The\\nPerformances deserve a special mention: Willem Dafoe is outstanding. An\\nIcredible Talent which we'll never forget! Charlie Sheen plays the\\nprotagonist with amazing understanding.

Only\\nthe second scene of the film and Oliver Stone lays his cards on the\\ntable for all to see. He does so because of confidence. Stone knows every frame of this film,\\nnot because he wrote it, but because he lived it. The combat is there,\\nbut if anything the firefights are the most dramatized piece of the\\nfilm. Here, the devil is in the details. The ants, the crotch rot, rain\\nfogging up a watch and burning sewer waste. These tiny facets of\\ninfantry life testify to the honesty in the story.Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias are the two fathers of the squad,\\ndespite neither being the real guy in charge. Each man is an amazing\\nsoldier in their own way. And they hate each other for ancient sins\\nunknown. Barnes is an intuitive and tough soldier with the scars to prove it.\\n\"Take the pain!,\" he tells one soldier who is screaming in agony. Elias\\nis a brave and cunning warrior but also humane. Stone uses these two men to show slices of men he actually served with,\\nbut also two differing mentalities of a warrior. One ruthless who lost\\nhis soul long ago, and the other a selfless man who looks over every\\nman in his group. This conflict between Tom Bereger\\'s Barnes and Willem\\nDafoe\\'s Elias is the narrative backbone to the jungle odyssey. This is\\nhigh drama, but never soap opera hokum. Every performance in the film is solid. A young Charlie Sheen does\\nquite well for himself in what is easily the best role he will ever\\nget. Dafoe and Berenger are perfect. For Oliver Stone too, though he\\nhas made other great films, I doubt Platoon will ever be topped.Platoon is high drama. The story is dense with conflict. There is a\\nvillain. There is morality. Whereas a modern war movie like The Hurt\\nLocker parades its realism through shaky cameras and endless\\ncross-cutting, deep inside it\\'s just Top Gun, Platoon doesn\\'t have the\\nNormandy sequence from Saving Private Ryan.

I have seen almost all Nam movies (Born on the 4th of July\\n\"Oliver Stone\", The Deer Hunter \"Michael Cimino\", Casualties of War\\n\"Brian De Palma and Stone happened to be screenwriter\", Apocalypse Now\\n\"Francis Ford Coppola\", etc..) and therefore, I can guilt-free-mindedly\\nsay that Platoon is by far the best of all. All the actors in the movie\\nwere excellent- Charlie Cheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger,Johnny Depp,\\nJohn C. McGinley (scrub), Kevin Dillon and others can\\'t remember now\\nbut all performed remarkably.Stone, though has a clear empathy for the soldiers of Nam, exhibits in\\na very provocative way the brutal acts of the soldiers to the locals.\\nThere is this one scene of the young Korean (or gook as the soldiers\\nreferred to them)with one leg and deformed eye who was hiding with his\\nmom under the ground and Kevin Dillon humiliates him and kills him.\\nThis scene is a clear sign that Stone sympathized with the locals and\\ndespised such indecent actions.

       " u'\\nWhen we see films about fighting in WWII, we see bonding and\\ncamaraderie. When we see films about fighting in Vietnam, we see\\nvindictiveness, rape, power plays and questionable loyalties. Filmed\\nwith a mixture of subjectivity, as we never leave the journey of the\\nstory\\'s particular platoon, and objectivity, as Stone tracks with them\\nfrom a distance through leaves and bushes, Platoon epitomizes the\\nVietnam experience. Stone may have based restless but controlled\\nCharlie Sheen\\'s Taylor character on himself, and the film may revolve\\naround him- --and one or two long takes indeed do just so---yet his\\nexperience is deeply felt by all of the characters. As he becomes more\\nand more hardened by his journey into the heart of war, Taylor finds\\nhimself brusquely wavering between those who gravitate fearfully toward\\nBarnes, an indestructible and forbidding return to one\\'s earliest\\nprimordial nightmares, played by Tom Berenger, whose acute perception\\ncommunicates the intimidating feeling of Barnes\\' presence, and those\\nwho gravitate toward Elias, a sagacious and optimistic veteran, played\\nwith self-contained receptiveness by Willem Dafoe, whose compadres,\\nsimilarly cool and detached, share his accepting aura. These two\\ncharacters are rivals with every ounce of willingness to mortally\\nconquer one another.What are alluring are the clues Stone leaves of the ideologies of the\\ntwo dominant men. The separate congregations of troops, killing time\\ntill plodding on the next scorching day, are introduced together\\nconsecutively, and again overlap each other before we again see them\\nenmeshed with each other as a seemingly unified single platoon. Taylor\\nis welcomed into a world of pot smoke, nostalgic tunes and\\nphilosophical aphorisms in Elias\\' hut, where Taylor\\'s existential\\ncomfort finds itself going to rejuvenate. We later hear Elias say to\\nTaylor, \"I love the stars. There\\'s no right or wrong in \\'em. They\\'re\\njust there, man.\" Barnes, on the other hand, shares his quarters with\\nmen who escape no further from the ever-crystallizing reality of their\\nsituation than knocking back beers and playing endless rounds of\\nclaustrophobic card games. We see a Confederate flag and a Jesus shrine\\nrespective of two peripheral bunkmates here. None of them, at any rate,\\nhave any patience for understanding the enemy or the man fighting with\\nthem, only enough to digress into the kill-or-be-killed level of fear-\\nand rage-fueled thought processes. So there we have it: the accepting\\nmentor and the intimidating idol, the one who awaits and welcomes free\\nassociation and the one who lethally forbids anyone to get, or happen\\nto be, in his way, and thus disrespect him. The blue team and the red\\nteam, the never-ending Civil War blurring the distinctions from the\\nnameless, faceless savages they must kill to survive. Indeed, there is\\nseldom a certain, indisputable shot of an enemy soldier.In other Vietnam films like Casualties of War, there is a\\ncharacterization of good and evil cast upon certain characters who do\\ndespicable things outside the bounds of their duty and certain ones who\\nreact righteously to them. In Stone\\'s inarguably most personal, semi-\\nautobiographical work, we spend the first half hour coming to like\\nseveral soldiers whom we, and Taylor, find to have monstrous sides once\\nBarnes leads them into terrorizing an alleged Viet Cong village in what\\nis considerably the most disquieting sequence. They are just like you\\nand me. They are not just dramatized characters.There is the invariable angst that any motion affords a coin-toss\\nprospect between a protected place or a threatened one. This film\\neasily being the peak profit of Stone\\'s craftsmanship, he assembles his\\nshots to exclude the notion that combat coalesces consistently. Rather\\nthan combat sequences in which lines are distinctly evoked, his battle\\nsequences comprise 360 degrees: Any blast or fired round might be aimed\\nat friend or enemy, and in the frantic urgency of combat, many of his\\nsoldiers never have a definite conception of precisely who they are\\nshooting at, or why.There is the music, not only the diverting jams of the era, but a\\nromantically somber orchestral throughline which Stone places with\\ninstinctive wisdom. Georges Delerue\\'s gentle, compliant and deceptively\\nvulnerable score sneaks in and out of the periphery. Similarly, the\\nreceptive humanitarian zeal of Samuel Barber\\'s Adagio For Strings\\nbecomes a relentlessly emotive servant of the universal concerns\\nawakened on screen.Stone essentially implies the U.S. lost the war in Vietnam owing to\\ntensions within its own forces and a disinclination to go all the way,\\nwhich leaves one with the dreadful consequence that the measureless\\nanguish and upheaval was for nothing. Stone was able to depict the\\nabomination of war without ever stylizing them. Rather, the effect is\\nall-encompassing chagrin, a generation lost in a conflict that it\\ndidn\\'t actually believe in, a generation of young men fighting for a\\ncountry that didn\\'t truly regard very highly or have a procedure for\\nwhat was really going on rapt in the jungles, within their own\\nplatoons. This was the story we needed to see. It would be the first in\\na trilogy of Vietnam War films from Stone which penetrated the bilious\\ninnards of the Vietnam predicament to present a succeeding generation\\nof Americans and for all those who were alive then the reality and the\\nunderhandedness of such a war.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThe craziness and ugliness of war is told with such realism, grit and\\ndeeply disturbing moments that Platoon must be appreciated for its\\nemotional engagement. The destruction of war on the human spirit and\\nsoul is deeply haunting.Platoon is not an easy watch, and I was left emotionally drained by the\\nexperience. This is testament to Oliver Stone and his screenplay, which\\nevokes raw emotion and a tense, alien environment through the\\ncinematography.Dafoe and Berenger are the most celebrated actors in Platoon, and that\\nis how it should be. There characters do have more depth than the\\nothers of the platoon but they are both exceptional and draw you into\\ntheir characters mindset. Although Sheen is very good as Chris Taylor,\\nI did not feel that he was cast correctly. I understand that Taylor is\\nan educated and affluent young-man but I felt he was a little too fresh\\nfaced, and rather unfitting for the role. I never succeeded in\\nbelieving in his reasoning to join the forces.I felt at times that the 'Adagio for Strings' was overplayed, if left\\nto certain moments it would of been more poignant and powerful. The\\nbest moment was when Taylor joined Dafoe and his men for a night of\\nrelaxation to the music of 'Tracks of my Tears' singing/dancing away,\\nit is so well-done that you are enraptured and share their moment of\\npeace and happiness.Platoon is one of the most poignant war films I have ever seen. Platoon\\nis shocking and hard to watch, but tells one much about the sheer\\nugliness of the human soul when confronted with such pitiful and dire\\ncircumstances.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nIn his breakthrough film, Stone relates the travails of a platoon of\\nsoldiers in Vietnam. The point Stone wants to make is that war is\\nbrutal. And he keeps making that point over and over again for two\\nhours. The film is nothing more than a series of battle scenes, with\\ninterludes for drugs and booze. The battles are less than compelling\\nbecause they are against a faceless enemy. Almost every line of the\\ndialog includes a popular four-letter word and its adjective form.\\nFurthermore, everybody spews clich\\xe9s.

       " u\"\\nI don't think this is Stone's best film to date. In fact, I loved JFK\\nand consider it to be a masterpiece. Platoon is a war film and I'm not\\ncrazy about war films in general but Stone's direction and personal\\nexperience with Vietnam is clearly an effective tool in this film's\\nbrilliance. It's raw, ugly, dirty, and filthy but then what war isn't\\nany of those things? As far as Vietnam films, I preferred the Deer\\nHunter but I am going to say that Platoon goes further where other\\nfilms have not gone before. It's different when the director has been\\nthere and done it himself as a Vietnam veteran like Roman Polanski who\\nsurvived World War II POland as a child. There is nothing that they are\\nnot afraid to show as if they are holding something back. This film is\\nabout war and the young men who go only to return home differently. As\\nfar as I know, this film is still important today as it was twenty\\nyears ago. First rate cast include Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and\\nother young men.\\n\",\n",

It\\nshows how hard the soldiers who fought in that war had it.One thing I really like about the movie is the characters. They are all\\nbelievable and give great performances on how war can make you crazy.\\nDafoe and Berenger are especially good. One of them is good hearted,\\nwhile the other one is ruthless.Charlie Sheen is a little to hard to take serious at times. After\\nwatching him in so many comedies, I just don't take him serious at all.\\nOther that Sheen, the acting is wonderful.Another Complaint I had is that it is disturbing and very uncomfortable\\nat times. If you have a problem with rape and innocent killing, you\\nwill have a problem with this movie.Other than that everything is fantastic. The battles are very well\\ndone. The battles have explosions, screaming, machine-gun fire and\\neverything you expect form a battle scene. When they aren't at battle,\\nthe film shows you how rough the military is. People are breaking down,\\nthere is a lot of racism and soldiers fighting each other.While this is a great movie, it is disturbing, and I had a hard time\\nwatching a few moments of it, but if you can bare with it,you can't\\nafford to miss this one.7/10\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoonA movie by Oliver Stone (1986) with a strong cast. Late sixties, full\\nblown war in Vietnam. Lots of different characters were there in war,\\nand everyone there had his own story and background. It' s nice to see\\nthat these characters are very well build by Stone, who plays a very\\nsmall part in the movie. The stupidness of the war is clear in this\\nmovie and no man there, Vietnamese or American is very happy with the\\nsituation, it s all politics. The movie starts with new soldier Chris\\nTaylor (Sheen) who comes right into action in a very diverse battalion\\nwith sgts Barnes and Grodin (Berrenger and Dafoe), the first a killing\\nmachine and the second a man who fights for the goods of the war. The\\nrest are a mixture of mainly poor under developed soldiers who take\\nthis chance to fight to escape from daily poverty. From day one they\\nare in the fire-line at the border with Cambodja and the fights are\\nheavy and ruthless. Every day people die and there s hardly a day of\\nrest. The only real leisure time is when they can smoke some dope, to\\nforget reality. Berrenger and Dafoe are constantly in a sort of fight\\nand the Leuitenant is not really man enough to control everything. Soon\\nthere are two groups in the camp and this makes them more vulnerable\\nfor the enemy. At the end no one could really see the situation clear\\nwith a massive slaughter as a result. Chris Taylor is a volunteer in\\nthe war, because he wanted to do something for his country, but at the\\nend he feels he could do almost nothing to change the situation.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nAnything nice you say about this film is like a whisper on a scream.\\nIt's a classic, it won awards, it has an unbelievably great cast. So\\nit's not like I really need to say anything more. But I will.I wasn't sure Charlie Sheen had the depth to carry on a role of this\\nmagnitude, but he did. His character was exactly like Harrison Ford's\\nIndiana Jones. Except that they have nothing in common. Well, that one\\nthing. They both hate snakes. Tom Berenger was ruthless. Willem Dafoe\\ndid the best damn job I've ever seen him do in a film and I found him\\nvery likable, which is odd considering how much I intensely hate Dafoe\\non a personal level (even more than Saddam Hussein hates Kurds). Dafoe\\nshines like a diamond in a field of A-holes.Kevin Dillon was so despicable that I found myself actually feeling the\\npain of the Vietnamese people. In my soul. I wanted to channel the\\nspirit of Ho Chi Minh to avenge the deaths of his people. I cried\\ntwice. It was very sad to see families torn apart and people treated\\nlike dogs or maybe even something worse. Johnny Depp will go down in\\nhistory for his role in this film - it is by far his best role and he\\nshould have received a supporting actor Oscar.But more than Depp, Dafoe or even Sheen - the scene-stealer was John\\nMcGinley. As Super-Lifer O'Neill he filmed the movie with anguish,\\nanger, humor, sadness, hopeless bleak despair, and sheer acting\\nconstipation. His Weird Al Yankovic-looking face made me smile while at\\nthe same time I was emotionally destroyed on the inside. McGinley, this\\nBud's for you. This film is awesome - very recommended!\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\"Platoon\" (1986): If \"The Thin Red Line\" is a contender for the\\nultimate poetic film about war (and I say it is), then \"Platoon\" is the\\ngritty, tense, realistic contender. There is NOTHING soft, easy,\\nrelaxing, funny, or romantic about this story. The acting is superb by\\nall (the list is too long, although Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, and\\nWillem Defoe take main characters), and each scene is a creation with\\nonly one goal in mind - to attempt an explanation of what it is to be a\\nsoldier in war. The photography is confusing and violent, the lighting\\nleaves movement and perception in doubt, the sanity of the characters\\nis fragile, the scoring is both epic and nostalgic. This is Art on all\\nlevels.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nAt the time it was released, PLATOON was said to be so realistic that\\nmany Vietnam vets who viewed it had psychotic flashbacks. My best\\nfriend, Randy, served two tours of duty in Vietnam in the late 1960s,\\nand because of these reports he was hesitant to see the film.\\nUltimately he attended a screening in the company of some two dozen\\nother vets who sat together to provide each other with support. When\\nthe film was over they looked at each other. \"Great film,\" they said.\\n\"But it wasn\\'t like that. Not really.\" Then they all went out for\\ncoffee and argued over some of the movie\\'s technical details. Randy\\nsays he has never met any vet who had a flashback episode from viewing\\nPLATOON, and he regards the story as so much Hollywood hype. Whether\\nthe stories of flashbacks are true or not, one thing is clear: PLATOON\\ndoes not capture the Vietnam experience for all vets, and it seems\\nunlikely that any one film ever could.Once we get past the film\\'s reputation and actually look at it, what we\\nhave is an extremely well-done film that posits itself as \"typical\\nVietnam experience\" and then offers us an not-very-subtle morality\\ntale. Although the film focuses on newly arrived soldier Chris Taylor\\n(Charlie Sheen), the storyline focuses on the battle of wills between\\nan ultra-hawk faction led by Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) who don\\'t care\\nwho they kill and an ultra-dove faction led by Sgt. Elias (Willem\\nDafoe) who want to maintain some sort of sense of humanity and\\nself-respect. The factions soon erupt into an internal war, with\\nBerenger increasingly portrayed as a demon from the pit and Dafoe seen\\nas a Christ-like figure, both symbolically fighting for the soul of\\nyoung and impressionable Sheen.In terms of combat scenes and violence, PLATOON is less horrific than\\nyou might expect. There are shockers, of course, but the film achieves\\nits effect less from graphic violence than from suspense, and here it\\nis extremely successful. Interestingly, the film also contains a\\ncovertly homo-erotic edge quite unlike that of any war film I\\'ve ever\\nseen. When the characters talk about women, they refer to them as\\nobjects and the few women who appear in the film are targets of rape\\nand murder, so the film equates heterosexuality with violence; on the\\nother hand, it is impossible to escape the connotation of the scene in\\nwhich Sheen is introduced to (i.e. seduced by) drugs in Dafoe\\'s lair,\\nwhich comes complete with party music, twinkle lights, and such lines\\nas \"put your mouth on this.\" Although the black-and-white nature of the\\nstory is simplistic almost to the point of annoyance, a truly fine cast\\ncarries the film off extremely well. Sheen is actually the weak link\\nhere: although appropriately All-American-Good-Boy he is not greatly\\nmemorable. Dafoe, however, is astonishingly good, and although very one\\nnote Berenger is a powerful metaphor for evil. The supporting cast\\nincludes exceptional performances from the likes of Forest Whitaker,\\nKevin Dillon (particularly effective as the loathsome \"Bunny\"), and\\neven a very young Johnny Depp. But Oliver Stone\\'s direction and script\\nhas a \"crusader\" mentality that undercuts any complexity the film would\\nhave, and PLATOON ultimately emerges as determinedly anti-war to the\\npoint of propaganda; consequently it never digs as deep as you feel it\\nshould. But what the film does do, it does extremely well. Recommended,\\nbut keep your critical faculties fully engaged throughout.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nIn the \"Trivia\" section, there are two inaccuracies. The first one\\nmentioned is \"Prior to going after Elias, Sgt. Barnes threatens to\\n\"article 15\" Taylor unless they return to the base camp. Article 15\\nrefers to U.S. military punishment for serious insubordination.\"\\nActually, an Article 15 is non judicial punishment, usually handed out\\nby an executive officer, or sometimes a first sergeant. Serious\\ninsubordination would be a courts martial offense.The second is \"At the end of the film, when the GI\\'s are tossing the\\nenemy dead into a mass grave, a stack of captured AK-47s can be seen\\npiled up. American soldiers actually preferred the AK-47 over the M-16,\\nbecause the AK-47 could be easily retooled to fire either U.S., or\\nVietnamese ammunition.\" GIs did prefer the AK-47 over the M-16 because\\nit was a more rugged gun with a more powerful punch than the M-16, and\\nit held up better in jungle climate of Viet Nam. Also the Ak-47 fires\\n7.62 mm round and the M-16 fires a 5.56 mm, so it would be impossible\\nto \"retool\" an AK-47 to fire the 5.56 round, let alone to fire either\\nround as stated.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is the first in a quadrilogy of reviews I'm set to write on the four\\ngreat Vietnam movies (Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, the Deer Hunter and\\nApocalypse Now).Even before I learned about the background to this movie, I had decided that\\nit was my personal favourite film about Vietnam. After I learnt about how\\nOliver Stone actually was a soldier in the war and wrote the script based on\\nhis own experiences, I believe more adamantly than ever that this is\\nprobably the greatest war film ever made. Charlie Sheen's character arrives in Vietnam, a principled kid from a\\nprivileged background who simply wants to do his part and fight for his\\ncountry. The war very quickly takes it's toll on him, and over a period of\\nweeks he becomes completely exhausted and more than a little insane. In the\\nplatoon he's joined there are two veteran soldiers played memorably by Tom\\nBerenger and William Dafoe, who are depicted as supermen, almost unkillable\\n-- and they represent the morality of the story. None of the men are exactly\\n'good' anymore, they're all killers certainly, but these two characters show\\nus that there IS a line, and they stand on opposite sides of it. The main\\ncharacter perceives that these two men are fighting for possession of his\\nsoul, a typical ego-centric philosophy student kind of conclusion, but in a\\nway they do represent a battle that is going on within this man, and that's\\nwhat the story is really about.All of the actors involved had to endure two weeks of intense training and\\nexercises which were aimed to teach them exactly what it was like to be a\\nsoldier in Vietnam, and in the making of this film there were moments when\\nthey really seemed to believe that they were there. There's one scene\\ntowards the end where John C. McGinley's character is upset because he\\ndoesn't think he'll make it out of the next battle alive, and he gives a\\ngreat performance where he is extremely emotional and close to tears -- but\\nthere's just one snag. He wasn't supposed to cry during that scene. The only\\ntake without tears was the one that they used in the film. On the DVD,\\nthere's an interview with Charlie Sheen where he says with a straight face\\nthat there were moments during shooting when he didn't think he'd make it\\nout of there alive.It wasn't an easy project for Oliver Stone either, as there were certain\\nscenes that seemed to spark memories for him as he'd obviously written them\\nabout something that had happened to him. The film provoked pretty much the\\nsame reaction from the veterans who saw it, everyone felt that he'd truly\\ncaptured something, which is probably why it won the oscars for best picture\\nand best director that year.You'll never hear Adaggio for Strings in quite the same way again. 5/5 (a\\nclassic, absolutely unmissable).\\n\",\n",

Yet, there just isn't enough emotional prowess\\nto warrant a feeling of sympathy for what the characters are subjected to. \\nI am not knocking this film though, I thought it was an entertaining piece\\nof work and a strong comment on the atrocities of war.  However, I do not\\nthink it is Stone's best film.  JFK is his best, and Platoon ranks to me\\nalongside of Born On the 4th, Talk Radio and The Doors.  Natural Born\\nKillers was even better than Platoon.  I can also not believe that Platoon\\nwon the Oscar for director, Lynch should have won for Velvet which was far\\nsuperior in every way to Platoon.  7 out of 10.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThe title of my comment really says it all. Oliver Stone is not known for\\nhis subtlety, his intelligence as a filmmaker or his writing skills. Such is\\nthe tragedy of Platoon.Platoon tells the story of a young, innocent man, Chris (Charlie Sheen) who\\nvolunteers for the Vietnam war, to contribute to the country he has taken so\\nmuch from. Here, he witnesses some terrible atrocities, and falls under the\\ninfluence of drugs and apathy. There is a good vs. evil conflict in not just\\nthe war aspect of the film, but Stone\\'s humanitarian aspect too. Tom\\nBerenger plays the hard-nosed veteran who frequently clashes with Willem\\nDafoe\\'s protective one. However, this is a war film, and as the bodies pile\\nup- so does the chaos for Chris, both physically and emotionally.Platoon, in a sense, has the same problem as Kubrick\\'s Full Metal Jacket,\\nitself a Vietnam movie made in the late 80s, over a decade after the end of\\nthe war. Platoon is essentially a film of two parts, but unlike FMJ, the two\\nparts of Platoon do not comply with the narrative. (In FMJ, the training\\nsection of the film gave us insight to a part of Vietnam we never saw\\nbefore- and so therefore the actual fighting, which we had seen before, was\\na let-down.) The first hour of Platoon is masterful, and proof that Oliver Stone can be\\ncoherent and subtle as a director and a writer. The second half of the film\\nhowever is a total mess. Unlike FMJ, it has not to blame the narrative\\nconstraints- but the writing and directing of the film itself. The\\nimmediately striking, coherent battle sequences of the first half become\\nmuddled and irritating in the second. The emotional impact of the film\\nbecomes deadened by over simplicity and the film becomes repetitive with\\nStone just lurching from one battle to the next.  With Natural Born Killers, Stone used his excessive film making techniques\\nas both self-parody and media commentary, with explosive and shocking\\nresults. The miscasting of John C. McGinley doesn\\'t help, as the cowardly\\ncomformist and neither does the underuse of Willem Dafoe. That said, the\\nfinal sequence of the film regains a sense of lost direction and rescues the\\nmovie from an otherwise \"A.I.\"-like second half slump.Flawed, frustrating yet mind numbingly tragic, Platoon is a worthy addition\\nto the Vietnam movie pantheon, although hardly the greatest of the Vietnam\\nmovies. Watch Stone\\'s \"Born on the fourth of July\" instead, for a more\\nsatisfying Vietnam experience. Or Apocalypse Now, or The Deer Hunter for the\\nbest Vietnam films.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nVisually stunning movie of a combat platoon in Vietnam. The atmosphere\\nand settings were beautifully filmed and conveyed, and the characters\\nwere extremely realistic and portrayed well.It\\'s hard to know what to feel about this film, though, as a military\\nveteran. For one thing it is hard to imagine a military unit getting\\nthis out of control. I have no doubt than many things portrayed here\\nhappened over there, but to this level? with no one stepping in? The\\nPlatoon had created virtually a \"Dodge City\" within their unit. I\\nunderstand that this war really got out of hand in many ways, but it\\'s\\nhard to come to grips with the murderous and thuggish attitude\\ndeveloping to this level without someone taking notice and stepping in.\\nMaybe it\\'s my wishful thinking, but I would hope that this situation\\nwould not take place. It may be what Stone is showing us is the\\ndesperation that we found ourselves in over there, we were willing to\\nunleash characters like Sergeant Barnes to wreak as much havoc on the\\nenemy as possible, and turning a blind eye to the means and methods he\\nused. Perhaps this is how a My Lai incident could happen. There was\\nample evidence of dysfunction and rage within that unit, but perhaps it\\nis to our benefit to use that rage and psychosis to achieve the body\\ncount which became so important in Vietnam? I am not sure of the\\nanswers to these questions; maybe there really aren\\'t any acceptable\\nanswers. Maybe this is the position guys like these were placed in,\\nwith no answers and no real guidance or objective, other than to\\nachieve as high an enemy body count as possible. To achieve this, you\\ndo not need thinking soldiers, or even a cohesive military unit. You\\nonly need a rage, a psychosis, and someone to focus and direct it -\\nBarnes.How does this then apply to Sergeant Elias, obviously a thinking\\nsoldier, and an advocate and representative of a cohesive military\\nunit? If he had won the battle for the hearts and minds of the men in\\nthe unit, would things have been different? He was certainly capable of\\nachieving the desired body count, but with a tighter,\\n\"watch-out-for-each-other\" leadership, as opposed to Barnes, who left\\nyou to your own devices, and presented death as a consequence for\\nmistakes.Some bits of this movie seemed overdramatized, and there is symbolism\\ngalore. However, beautifully filmed, and the atmosphere is pure hot,\\nsweaty jungle, with mayhem lurking behind every tree.Astonishing Job by Tom Berenger. This has always been thought of as\\nCharlie Sheen\\'s movie. Not to me. Tom Berenger\\'s Sergeant Barnes\\ncharacter virtually dominated this movie. He has not shown this level\\nof performance in anything else he\\'s done, really, but this is simply\\nthe performance of a lifetime. His was a bigger than life character.

If you watch\\nApocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket then you know how totally stupid Platoon\\nis. The acting from Sheen is awful, Dafoe is good. Berenger is okay aswell.\\nBut the rest of the entire cast is c grade material. The fight scenes were\\npathetic, think about it for a second. Hundreds of the enemy is advancing,\\nbut Sheen picks up is machine gun and sprints through the jungle and kills\\nabout 40 of them just because he had an adrenaline burst, give me a\\nbreak.An for those people out there who think this is any good, I hope your\\nrobocop and police academy dvd collections are going well.DON'T WATCH THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThat this movie won the best picture Oscar back in the eighties is\\nutterly mystifying. At heart, it\\'s a pretty basic war movie, but its\\npretensions are what causes it to fail. Oliver Stone has never been one\\nfor subtlety, but he might as well have had subtitles explaining what\\nthe symbolism was, since it is so obvious. The movie is, in fact, about a platoon. It hasn\\'t much to say about the\\nVietnam War itself--or the Viet Cong, or really the Vietnamese, since\\nthey\\'re mostly background. The movie itself is about America, and how\\nit dealt with the War, which is all well and good. But if this is\\nsupposed to be some sort of social statement, about the conflict in\\nVietnam, and how wrenching the war was for American society, Stone\\nreally oughtn\\'t to have been so mindlessly simplistic about this\\nplatoon. The good and evil parts are almost parodies, at best comic book\\ncharacters; most war movies are about the good guys versus the bad\\nguys. Nothing wrong with that. But if this is a movie that\\'s supposed\\nto rise above the rest and be taken as a \"serious\" movie, something a\\nbit more nuanced and complex is required. Stone offers up stereotypes\\ninstead: We have the platoon in a virtual civil war, with the southern\\nJack Daniels swilling, country music rednecks led by scarred Tom\\nBerenger on one side, and representing evil; and the \"good\" guys led by\\nWillem Dafoe, as drug addled peaceniks, including all the blacks. This is in some fashion supposed to offer Charlie Sheen, the empty\\ncenter of this movie, a choice between two poles, but he\\'s never\\nconflicted, he clearly moves into Dafoe\\'s circle from the beginning.\\nAnd the rest of the movie is just a standard war movie. Again, nothing\\nwrong with that, Stone can use a camera pretty well, and the\\nsoundtrack, a little standard but okay, works. All in all a mediocre\\nmovie sunk by trying to be something that it isn\\'t. Try out \"Hamburger Hill\" instead, or possibly \"The Boys In Company C\",\\nfor something a little more interesting about Vietnam.\\n',\n",

I felt so sorry for the women and children who were torchered in the\\nmovie when yet they haven't done a darn thing.

While\\nPlatoon is a good overall movie, I found it to be very shallow.  I didn't\\nfeel that any actors gave outstanding performances.  I couldn't relate to\\nany of them because the movie didn't give background or develop characters\\nin a way that would show me why they were crazy, scared, strong, weak, etc.\\nCharlie Sheen was very weak.

       " u\"\\nPlatoon (1986)A movie with one goal: recreating the hell of war, Vietnam specifically\\nbut war in general. And it succeeds. It has strong acting, spectacular\\nspecial effects, lots of rain and night shots (and snakes and bugs), a\\nlot of death from every possible cause, and a steady, suspenseful pace.\\nIt's a really good movie, and at times really sucks you in.It's also a movie with lots of well used themes, with stereotypes (in\\nthe soldiers) and with more stereotypes (very cardboard, in the\\nenemies). And there is no real plot. There is a progression, yes, and\\nthings go from bad to worse until the climax of an ending. But the\\ndevelopment of the characters and their interactions is thin, and the\\nmission of the platoon, whatever it quite is, lacks clarity. And a question might rise for anyone looking for a statement about\\nVietnam--was it really so ruthless and murderous, soldiers killing\\nsoldiers and civilians so readily? Or is this the worst of the worst?\\nAnd if so, shouldn't it make that clear? Not that fiction needs to be\\naccurate, but if we go back to the goal of showing what war is like,\\nthen this might not be what war is like. This is what a demented, blood\\nthirsty platoon looks like, led by the evil selfish soldier played by\\nTom Berenger. With a couple of heroes holding things together, like the\\nsuper fighter played by Willem Dafoe.There are of lots of regular guys, all of them interesting and\\nsympathetic--Johnny Depp and Forest Whitaker as examples. And there is\\na ton of trivia, too, outlined in detail in the IMDb page. Director\\nOliver Stone wanted the movie to be realistic in the details, too, and\\nwent to some extreme to pull that off. I don't think he wanted an\\noriginal movie (it's no Apocalypse Now, for sure), but he wanted a\\nmainstream, dramatic, moving experience, which he got.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis is a good movie, and a brave one, for several reasons. The plot\\nand other elements of the film have been covered elsewhere, so I\\'d like\\nto just make a few comments on the role of race in the Vietnamese\\nconflict.The combat experience in Vietnam was an almost perfect mirror of a\\nfamous social psychology experiment by Muzafer Sheriff called, \"The\\nRobbers Cave\" study. This may look a little dull but it\\'s important and\\nrelevant.Under controlled conditions, Sheriff brought two matched groups of boys\\nto a Boy Scout Camp in the middle of nowhere. In Phase One, the two\\ngroups had no contact with one another but gave themselves names (The\\nEagles and the Rattlers) and lived separately. They developed an\\nintense in-group bonding.In Phase Two, the Eagles and the Rattlers were brought together in\\ncompetition with one another -- sports and so forth. And each group\\ndeveloped an intense antagonism for the other, an \"us-against-them\" set\\nof attitudes. The hostility grew so strong that the experimenters cut\\nPhase Two short so it wouldn\\'t become physically dangerous.In Phase Three, the competitive tasks were removed and replaced by\\ntasks requiring cooperation for the good of both groups together. The\\ncrises were artificially created by the experimenters and involved\\njoint jobs like hauling water when the pump broke down, pulling a truck\\nwhen the engine quit, and so on. The conflict disappeared when it was\\nreplaced by what Sheriff called \"a superordinate goal\" or \"a\\nsuperordinate enemy.\" The film illustrates the kind of bonding that takes place when the\\nEagles and the Rattlers are faced with a superordinate enemy, in this\\nstory the VC. There\\'s no question that racial identities were retained,\\nbut they were overshadowed by allegiance to the group. They had to be,\\nfor the sake of survival. The casual and sometimes friendly interaction\\nbetween African-Americans and whites is even more surprising when you\\nconsider that this takes place in the late 1960s, the era of Black\\nPower, the Zebra killings, campus takeovers, and so on. None of that\\nsocial movement filters into Vietnam. There may or may not be atheists\\nin foxholes, but there seem to be far fewer racists.Enough boring stuff. I mentioned that the film was brave because Stone\\nwas the first guy to come out with a film that dealt directly with the\\nordinary grunts in the Vietnam war. No politics or anything. None of\\nthat, \"Why are we here?\" business. The war is just a matter of getting\\nthrough one day after another, shorter and shorter, until you can get\\nout of it.The usual stereotypes are either absent entirely or weak. Nobody is a\\nwise guy from Brooklyn. And there is no braggart from Texas. And Sgt.\\nElias is not \"good\" in contrast to Sgt. Barnes\\' \"bad\" guy. He\\'s a\\nbetter human being than Barnes, but not a better soldier.Overall, it\\'s an instructive film coming from somebody who was there.\\nAnd the director doesn\\'t try to drive us nuts with razzle dazzle\\ntechniques as he sometimes does in his later work.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThis solid masterpiece from Oliver Stone depicts the dehumanization\\nthat occurs among platoon mates (soldiers become obsessed with killing\\nand losing self-control), as well as the horrific effects of waging a\\nwar (Innocent getting killed, unnecessary destruction). Realistic and\\nemotional, this film serves as a reminder of how the soldiers paid for\\nthe price of freedom and the sacrifices they made, and offers an\\ninteresting view on war. Though painful to watch, it is ultimately\\nrewarding. Well-crafted and featuring casts giving their best to their respective\\nroles, this is one of the best war classics I have seen as of this\\nwriting.\\n',\n",

The scene in the village is\\nimmensely emotional and beautifully executed.In a war movie, you normally shouldn\\'t have to explain who the villains\\nare, however in this one it is necessary. The enemy, not exactly\\nvillains, are the Vietcong, but there is another enemy. SSGT. Barnes is\\nabout as big as an enemy within the Platoon can get, and by \"big\" I\\nmean ruthless. Ruthless not just to his own men, but also to the\\nVietcong, seen in great detail in the village.

This is a great jump on his\\nearly career.Like I stated before, the best war movie comes down to opinion.

The platoon is a small hostile family of\\ntestosterone junkies who want nothing more than to kill the \"gook\\nb****rds.\" They don\\'t give in to bargaining, they don\\'t take any s**t\\nand they are hard as nails.

       " u\"\\nPLATOON (1986)---- I have now seen Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket,\\nHamburger Hill, The Deer Hunter and Platoon. Of these 5 Vietnam dramas,\\nI must say, Platoon is the best. Previously, I'd say Deer Hunter was\\nthe best, but after seeing Platoon, I have changed my mind. The Deer\\nHunter is still a masterpiece (as are the others, except for maybe\\nHamburger Hill), but I think that since Platoon is leaner, it has a\\nslight advantage. Everyone says that The Deer Hunter's 30 minute\\nwedding sequence develops the characters (which it does, to a certain\\ndegree) but I find it overly long. Now to the actual review: Platoon begins in late 1967. Chris Taylor\\n(Charlie Sheen) has volunteered for the US army, and has been sent to\\nVietnam. Here, we are introduced to two sergeants: BARNES (Tom\\nBerenger) and ELIAS (Willem Dafoe). They are fierce rivals, and have\\nvery differing opinions on the war. The lieutenant of this platoon\\nsends Elias' squad (which happens to include Taylor) on an ambush\\nmission. As the squad sleeps, Taylor watches. His shift ends, and he\\nwakes up the next man. Chris awakens later, to find that Junior (the\\nother man) has been sleeping the whole time. Expectedly, the Vietnamese\\nattack, and the platoon loses a man. Taylor is left responsible, and it\\nis here that he personally meets Barnes, a ruthless bastard who at\\nfirst, Taylor admires. Throughout the movie, Taylor is in constant\\n(emotional) pain. The movie is excellently acted. Charlie Sheen\\nconvinces you that Chris Taylor has many moral dilemmas. However, this\\nis one of the only movies that has actually disturbed me. Maybe because\\nit's so real. And that makes it even better. Barnes is simply sick, as\\nis one of his followers, a man nicknamed Bunny. Chris begins to be\\ndisgusted with him, and as the platoon torches a Vietnamese village, he\\nis shocked to find some of the US soldiers, his allies, raping a woman.\\nThe war is making him agitated and crazy, and as they are evacuating\\nthe village, he scares a Vietnamese man half to death with gunfire.\\nHowever, Chris has a heart, he only wants the man out. Bunny (like I\\nsaid) is the horrible human being, and he casually smashes the man's\\nface in, while his wife is cowering on the floor. Not to be outdone,\\nBarnes is trying to find out where this village got a huge stockade of\\ngrain. He threatens a man, and beats him around a little. A woman\\nstanding next to him (his wife) starts screaming and becomes\\nhysterical. Barnes' solution? He shoots her in the head. Barnes badly\\nwants the answer to his question. A young girl in the crowd is crying\\nover her mother's murder. Barnes is so desperate (scratch that,\\ndisgusting) that he grabs her and puts a gun to her head. Elias (the\\ngood sergeant) starts to beat the hell out of the heartless bastard,\\nand then he becomes blacklisted. The soldiers from the beginning are\\ndivided into two groups, those that follow Barnes, and those that\\nfollow Elias. Barnes' men are all cold and don't have much regard for\\nhuman life. The worst part is when the soldiers are engaged in another\\nbattle. While the majority of soldiers fight at the fore-front, Elias\\nbelieves that they may get flanked, and goes solo. He successfully\\nkills all the opposing Vietnamese, only to be greeted by three of\\nBarnes' bullets. Barnes leaves him for dead, and tells Taylor that\\nElias died. Taylor has become a close friend of Elias', and takes this\\nhard. The surviving soldiers board a helicopter. However, in a\\nmasterfully directed sequence, we see Elias' bloody figure running away\\nfrom dozens of Vietnamese. This scene struck an emotional chord with\\nme. In this movie full of sick individuals, (many of which are only\\ninterested in killing and maiming) one of the only likable and\\nrespectable characters, is gunned down, backed by a chilling score. This movie is amazing, real, and at times, disturbing. Watch it.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nI expected this to be a another semi-cheesy and mediocre war film\\nthat's only worth watchable once, and even that might be an\\noverstatement. I was pleasantly surprised when it turned about to be\\nfairly accurate about the immorality and horror of Vietnam (since I'm\\njust a teenager I obviously don't know s**t myself, I'm basing that\\nfrom what I've heard from vets)and also stars Willem Dafoe, who's\\nalways great and fun to watch. It's cool how there aren't any\\nprotagonists in this movie; the guy you'd expect to be the hero\\n(Charlie Sheen) turns out to be just another dude who's corrupted by\\nthe war and turns into bandanna-sporting pothead (but what's wrong with\\nthat?). On a parallel with the primary review, my favorite scene was\\nalso when Elias comes hauling ass out of the forest, getting shot\\nrepeatedly and getting into that dramatic but somehow not cheesy\\nposture while the Huey books it out of there. Barnes is obviously very\\nhate-able, while the other characters fit into their roles well. The\\nmovie's the right length (2 hours), features some nice cinematography\\nin the jungles, is free of cheesiness, is realistic and features strong\\nperformances from its cast. This movie definitely gets a 10/10 (trying\\nnot to be biased) and is without a doubt worth buying. In my opinion,\\nit's a tie between Platoon and Apocalypse Now concerning which is a\\nbetter Vietnam movie (although Apocalypse Now is definitely more\\nsurreal), but the solution if you haven't seen them is to rent and then\\nbuy both.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is above Apocalypse Now on my top 150 list, because I've always felt it\\nshows a wider range of emotions and characters, and perhaps it is easier to\\nidentify with the struggle each man feels. Every actor is effective, from\\nthe leads, to the smaller parts like that of Kevin Dillon; his Bunny is both\\nfunny and horrifying. Stand out images: obviously that of Defoe, arms\\nstretched to the sky as the outstanding music soars, but one of my\\nfavourites is the post napalm scene, when the jungle changes colour.\\nBrilliant. The movie goes straight for your throat, shocking you at every\\nturn, and although you may feel desensitized to some extent by the end, the\\nimages of brutality will stay on. Think war is fun?

       " u\"\\n\\nMost films about the Vietnam War deliver a powerful message. Apocalypse Now\\nshows how war can drive a man to insanity and darkness, Full Metal Jacket\\nfocuses on dehumanization and turning wimps into killing machines, and The\\nDeer Hunter tells the story of a simple friendship swept away by the tide of\\nwar. Then there's Platoon, which shows how allies can start a war amongst them\\nand become bigger dangers to one another than their real enemies. It also\\nshows how the fight for leadership can tear into the ones who fight for it.\\nBut this conflict affects the soldiers most of all, and they must decide\\nwhether their loyalties are with the bitter, tough-as-nails leader (Tom\\nBerenger), or the more faithful and supportive one (William Dafoe).SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS\\nMOVIE!!!Platoon's gripping and unmerciful story is told by soldier Chris Taylor\\n(Charlie Sheen), a college dropout who put his education behind just to\\nbecome a soldier. He is assigned to a platoon of mixed personalities and\\nraces such as Big Harold (Forest Whitaker), Rhah (Francesco Quinn), and Sgt.\\nO'Neill (John McGinley). The soldiers must deal with the brutality and\\nsickening reality of war: Rotting corpses, red ants biting your neck, swarms\\nof gnats and mosquitoes that leave swollen bites all over your face,\\nbooby-trapped bunkers, and Viet Cong platooning by night. But the biggest\\nthreat to the well being of the band is the battle for its command.The platoon's leadership is split between scar-faced Sgt. Barnes (Berenger)\\nand Sgt. Elias (Dafoe). Sgt. Barnes is a hateful and ungracious troop who\\nkills with a vengeance. Elias is a man who has lost faith in the war, but\\nstill cares for his fellow soldiers. At first the two are able to cooperate,\\nbut when they are faced with a threat or are caught in a tight situation\\ntheir decisions are almost exactly different. If a man were wounded, Barnes\\nwould rather leave his body to rot rather than tend to him, whereas Elias\\ncalls in for medical attention immediately. When the platoon invades a\\nVietnamese village, Barnes will shoot anybody who dares to try and stop him\\nand even threatens to kill a child, but Elias would rather save the\\ncivilians and do what must be done. The conflict between the two eventually\\nreaches boiling point, and when Elias stumbles upon Barnes during a\\nVietnamese troop invasion, his ungrateful rival shoots him. Taylor, whose\\nloyalty had been with Elias during his gruesome stay, starts to believe that\\nBarnes shot Elias when he sees the wounded and helpless sergeant praying for\\nmercy while being hunted down by Viet Cong troops. When they meet back at\\nbase later on, Chris jumps right to conclusions with Barnes and attempts to\\nkill him. He fails, however, and Barnes isn't daunted.The next day, the platoon heads out to the jungle once more to battle the\\nVietnamese troops. The Viet Cong strike late at night, attacking the\\nAmerican bunkers and outposts with full force. As bullets ricochet\\neverywhere and explosions and fires erupt, a scrambling Taylor runs into\\nBarnes, who has gone insane and is repeatedly stabbing a Viet Cong troop to\\ndeath. Taylor pulls Barnes back, who pins him down and holds his knife high\\nabove him, ready to stab him to death. As Chris screams, a jet flies\\noverhead and launches bombs, sending the forest up in a fiery napalm\\nexplosion and wiping nearly everything out. When Taylor wakes up the next\\nmorning, he finds a severely injured Barnes crawling across the ground in\\nsearch of medical aid. When he turns around to find Taylor pointing a rifle\\nat him, he says, `Go ahead. Shoot me.' In two seconds he's lying on the\\nground with bullets in his chest. Then, all of a sudden, a search team\\narrives to rescue Taylor and bring him back to the helicopter landing field.\\nHe is then carried aboard one on a stretcher, his time in Vietnam finished.\\nBut as the chopper sails over the smoking and body-ridden battlefield,\\nTaylor begins to cry, realizing that the biggest enemy of all proved to be\\nthemselves.Shortly put, this is one of the best films ever made. One of the many things\\nthat helps it achieve its status of greatness is the message it delivers. It\\nbasically shows how war can wreck the lives of those sucked in, and although\\nthere aren't any metaphorical aspects to it or such, it's still a powerful\\nmessage that is perfectly exemplified by Oliver Stone. You can clearly see\\nit right at the beginning when leaving troops shoot a cold glance towards\\nChris and the other newcomers. And from there on it becomes stronger and\\nstronger.But perhaps the best thing about the entire movie is the tension that\\nconstantly builds during each climax. The way Stone makes the Viet Cong\\nappear as camouflaged silhouettes is eerie, presenting them as faceless,\\nghostlike figures. The very first climax with Taylor watching the Vietnamese\\ntroops in silence as they approach is perfectly shot from different angles,\\nimplying a strong sense of fear and anxiety upon the viewer. And when the\\ntension lets up, it's perfectly relieved by a pulse-pounding sequence that\\nmoves at a fast pace. The casting in Platoon is also good as well. Charlie Sheen follows the\\nfootsteps of his father with a stellar performance and well-placed narrating\\n(Like father, like son). Tom Berenger is good, but I found his character\\nalmost impossible to like. Naturally, I preferred William Dafoe, who would\\nprobably be my pick for the best performance in the movie. The performances\\nof Forest Whitaker and John McGinley are also good, and the film features\\nplenty of other soon-to-be-famous faces like Johnny Depp and Keith David.\\nBut the problem with Platoon's characterization is that it tries to cover\\ntoo many different people at once, making it a bit hard to follow each\\ncharacter. But that has got to be the only flaw in general. And since the\\ncharacters are perfectly developed, it's not much of a problem.Platoon is simply a great movie, and it is right on the grand scale of great\\nwar films like Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and The Deer Hunter.\\nEverything is perfect, from the action to the cinematography, and it's about\\nas good as a war movie can get. All in all, a must see film.***** out of *****\\n\",\n",

I have watched Platoon\\nseveral times and it never fails to capture what a war was (or is) and\\nhow it affects people in different ways and the conflict war brings not\\njust between opposing armies, but between each other.In this case it provides a very emotional account of a person that\\nendures some torturous moments that are sometimes hard to watch - which\\nis obviously what films should do, make you really feel what the actors\\nportray! Some right characters and a story to get your teeth into .I think this film deserves more credit.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\"Platoon\" was an incredible movie I just watched last night. To be\\nhonest, I don\\'t think too much of what the soldiers in Iraq are going\\nthrough right now. Unfortunately, one of my friends has been shipped\\nover to Iraq and won\\'t be back until next year. The only thing I worry\\nabout is if he\\'ll be alright.\"Platoon\" showed how much a soldier can loose in a war. His sanity,\\nhealth, and innocence. You see the transition of Taylor\\'s behavior, he\\ncomes to Vietnam a little nieve and not realizing what he had just got\\nhimself into. But at the middle and towards the end, he becomes a \"man\"\\nby the army\\'s standards.William Defoe, what a terrific under rated actor! I\\'ve just recently\\nhave been seeing more of his movies and he is just so great. His\\ncharacter touched my heart. Because he is one of the more experienced\\npeople in his troop. He even tells how the Americans were kicking butt\\nin the beginning and now it\\'s their turn to get it. When he punched\\nBarnes when he held the gun to the little girl\\'s head, I was hoping\\nthat he would\\'ve killed Barnes. But his character won me over.\"Platoon\" is a great Vietnam movie and I would recommend it. But it is\\nvery violent and graphic. Not recommended for kids under 16. Otherwise,\\njust enjoy.8/10\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nPlatoon ranks up there as being one of the greats in war films. Why? My\\nview is because of the angle that it takes on the Vietnam War. Platoon\\nis a movie that drops you straight into the war and within five minutes\\nof seeing the film, you feel like your there with the soldiers. The\\nfilm follows a young soldier (Sheen) who volunteered and his struggles\\nas he is torn apart between two sergeants. The best praise I can give\\nto this film is it's ability to totally engross you in almost every\\ncharacter in the platoon. There are some very disturbing parts in the\\nfilm, but they are only placed there to show the true horror of war and\\nthe affects it can have on men. I recommend this film to anybody that\\nlikes war films. It's a must.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI think, initially, that \"Platoon\" became to a sociological phenomenon,\\nunintentionally. I don\\'t know whether the American nation was just\\nmature for a reconciliation with the veterans of Vietnam, who were\\nneglected and reviled by society after they returned, or it was just an\\nexcellent film, that brought the people out of their shells and the ice\\nto melt. I am not sure about that and it is not from importance. What\\nis important is that \"Platoon\" brought a reconciliation between\\nAmerica\\'s veterans of Vietnam, their families who didn\\'t know anything\\nabout their experiences of war and the opponents of the Vietnam war.Regarding this movie, it is outstanding in its intention and in its\\nmaking of. I think I don\\'t have to say more about it.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nPerhaps one of the most over rated yet necessary films made.  Typical of\\nOliver Stone, the imagery is wooden and the characters stereotypical.  Yet\\nin spite of the crassness of his eye, the movie tells the story of Vietnam\\nin a manner that communicates the complexities of the war to average movie\\ngoers.  If we juxtapose Stone\\'s handling of the Mi Lai massacre with\\nCoppola\\'s metaphorical scene of the slaughter of innocents by the boat crew\\nin Apocalypse Now, you see the difference between the art film making and\\nthe \"art\" of self righteous cinematic flotsam.  Yet on a real level, Platoon\\nwas released during the heat of Reganism and the nationalist chest pounding\\nthat went along with it.  Society was swallowing the palled justifications\\nfor world wide police actions easier than trickle down economic theory.  In\\nthis vein, this hyperbolic reminder of the last great feat of American\\nnationalism run amok was well timed. Unfortunately, this film gave Stone the\\ncredibility with which he bashed us with such gems as \"Wall street\", \"Born\\non the Fourth of July\", and the seminal example of the girth of his ego,\\n\"JFK\".  However, this is a small price to pay if he presented the dangers of\\nbeing a myopic super power to a polity that had just re-elected an actor as\\nPresident.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nIn this great film Oliver Stone paints a nice but realistic (and therefore\\nsometimes shocking) picture of what the Vietnam War must have been like in\\nthose days.  In a brilliant way, Stone shows us how the Americans were\\nrather fighting among themselves than against the \\'real\\' enemy out there. \\nHe also points out that this must have been one of the main reasons why\\nAmerica didn\\'t win the war.  This piece of information is what the film is\\nall about.  Besides the actual Vietnam War you can see the development of\\nanother \\'personal\\' war that starts with a stupid incident but becomes just\\nas strong and dangerous as the real war.  Good men were killed when they\\ncould have been saved.In this film, Charlie Sheen is a young soldier who\\'s just started out in\\nVietnam.  He\\'s caught between two superiors who (as he said so himself)\\nfight for the possession of their souls.  There\\'s the morally corrupt,\\nmerciless \\'killer machine\\' Sgt. Barnes and the much more humane Sgt. Elias\\nwho wants to teach his men a sense of compassion and responsibility.\"Platoon\" is a great film, in particular because Oliver Stone creates such a\\nthrilling and realistic atmosphere throughout the entire picture.  The\\ncamerawork is excellent and original too, since Stone becomes a part of his\\nown film by acting as if he were one of those soldiers.  Most of the film\\ntakes place in the jungle, but this so-called lack of variation is never\\nboring.  The scenes in the jungle are really nerve-wracking, as you never\\nknow what could happen next.  A brilliant thing about these jungle-scenes is\\nthe piece and quiet at one moment where you can literally hear the birds\\nsinging and the ear-deafening noise of gunfire and grenades that (to\\nanyone\\'s surprise) follows in the scene hereafter.\\nBecause of an interesting story with great acting performances and wonderful\\ncamerawork Oliver Stone will keep you attached to the screen for the whole\\ntime being.  It\\'s a good thing that the film doesn\\'t last any longer than\\ntwo hours, because after this time you\\'ve had it with Vietnam, despite the\\nfact that you\\'ve really seen a great film!  The acting of both Charlie Sheen\\nand Tom Berenger are good, but it\\'s Willem Dafoe who is simply wonderful as\\nSgt. Elias.  He received an Oscar nomination for his performance, but not an\\naward.  Back to Charlie Sheen for a moment: like father like son.  His\\nfather was in a Vietnam-film as well and he did the voice-over in that film.\\n Well, his son Charlie Sheen does exactly the same as his father did many\\nyears ago.  Charlie Sheen plays in a Vietnam-film as well and takes care of\\nthe voice-over in \"Platoon\".  Both do a great job, but father Martin\\'s\\nvoice-over in \"Apocalypse now!\" is still somewhat better.All in all, \"Platoon\" is a very good film that gives the viewer an\\ninsightful representation of how the Americans (sorry to say) lost the\\nVietnam War.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nWhen \"Platoon\" premiered, Time Magazine ran a cover spread with the\\ntitle \"Vietnam as it really was\". Other pundits applauded director\\nOliver Stone for his \"truthful account of the Vietnam War\". Of course,\\nthese songs of praise largely occurred in America. Elsewhere in the\\nworld, such films were viewed as just more tedious propaganda, which\\nserved only to further rob entire generations of a right to factual\\ninformation and further mythologise a deliberately obfuscated war.But what\\'s worse is the way these films purport to be \"anti-war\", but\\nthen treat war as a coming-of-age ritual, a rights of passage into\\nmanhood in which our heroes endure exciting action sequences and then,\\nat least in \"Platoon\\'s\" case, benefit from these experiences (as\\nexplained in \"Platoon\\'s\" excruciating final voice-over).These films covertly endorse war, serving up tales of a rag-tag bunch\\nof racially diverse guys who \"don\\'t know what they\\'re fighting for\" but\\nare nevertheless \"willing to die for their brothers\". Elsewhere the\\n\"horrors\" which these soldiers commit are simply dismissed as acts of\\ntemporary insanity, rather than systemic atrocities ordered from above.\\nWorse still is the way these films tend to treat Vietnam as a lost war,\\nbut a noble one, America simply guilty of being overly generous to a\\npoint of naivety, the Vietnamese population \\x96 portrayed as primal and\\nbarbaric - ultimately to blame for the pain inflicted upon the American\\npsyche. The historical truth, of course, is the opposite: the US sided with\\nFrench Imperialism before the war, was neither supported by Northern\\nVietnam or the South, did everything it could to scuttle elections and\\nunification, disobeyed Geneva mandates, propped up puppet dictators,\\nartificially and deliberately divided a nation, killed over 4 million\\nVietnamese, raped the country, engaged in large scale torture, bombing,\\nwar-crimes and detainments, faked terrorist acts, funded and armed\\nwarlords, forced the displacement of five million, and violently\\nsubverted the will of a 80 percent majority who wanted democratic\\ncommunism. But that\\'s how the US, in tandem with the Imperial powers of\\nyesteryear, habitually operates: vote for who we don\\'t want and we\\ncrush you. The truth is, most films touted as being \"Vietnam war films\", aren\\'t\\nreally about the Vietnam War; they\\'re simply about confused and\\nanguished Americans. \"Platoon\", like \"First Blood\", presented itself as\\nan attempt to reconcile Americans with what had happened in Vietnam.\\nBut unlike \"First Blood\", which brought Vietnam back home and forced\\nAmericans to confront the scars, \"Platoon\" yanks us back to Asia and\\ninvites us to experience the everyday \"truths\" of how soldiers\\nexperienced the war, the film designed to heal the wounds of a \"great\\nnation\" undeservedly \"defeated\" at the hands of a poverty-stricken\\nthird world country (the notion that America was \"defeated\" is itself\\nmythology. America achieved its real goals in Vietnam, in much the same\\nway it did in Iraq, another supposedly \"failed war\").So at its core, \"Platoon\" is a fairly straightforward morality play.\\nChris, played by Charlie Sheen, is a young soldier who must (like his\\ncharacter in Stone\\'s \"Wall Street\") choose between two fathers. The\\nfirst father is Sgt Elias, a tough but gentle sergeant, and the second\\nis Sgt Barnes, an evil brute. Elias represents the mud-stained American\\nideal, whilst Barnes represents a kind of corrupt devil who believes\\nthat men of principle are weak and that evil is within everyone.The film ends with two successive apocalypses. In the first, Elias is\\nabandoned and dies like Christ, a horde of Vietcong devils engulfing\\nhim whilst Chris betrays him and angelically rise up into the skies.\\nBut this is a false resurrection. The last good man \\x96 the moral heart\\nof America \\x96 has been left behind to die on the cross, leaving Chris\\nalone with Barnes, a kind of demonic God.To salvage his soul, Chris must thus venture back into the jungle-hell,\\navenge Elias and kill Barnes, an incident which takes place in the\\nfilm\\'s final apocalypse. Here, amongst the devilish shadows of the\\nVietcong, Chris confronts Elias and kills him, before being once again\\nlifted up into the skies. In Stone\\'s mythology, America is neither\\nfighting Vietnam nor defeated by it. Rather, America is struggling to\\nconfront and dispatch its own demons, that of collective memory and\\nnational guilt. She then re-learns how to be a good warrior nation.The devil sergeant destroyed and the Christ hero avenged, Chris(t)\\nfrees America and is then lifted off into the sunset like a body\\nresurrected into some easier, more comfortable tomorrow. \"I have felt\\nlike the child of these two fathers,\" Chris then says. \"We did not\\nfight the enemy, we fought ourselves, and the enemy was within us.\\nThose of us who made it have an obligation to build again, to teach to\\nothers what we know and to try with what\\'s left of our lives to find a\\ngoodness and meaning to this life.\" And so \"Platoon\" dissolves defeat and serves up a cathartic experience\\nin which memory is erased and the American dream persists. Elsewhere\\nthe film is resolutely goofy, with Barber\\'s \"Adagio for Strings\"\\noverused (cribbed from \"Elephant Man\"), too much romanticised insanity,\\ngoofy poetry, high-school symbolism and the kind of macho posturing\\nthat now seems silly post \"Tropic Thunder\", \"Hot Shots\" and \"Full Metal\\nJacket\\'s\" self-aware caricatures. Furthermore, Stone throws in every\\nclich\\xe9 (the village trial, the racist, the southern soldiers, the\\nineffective officer who almost always gets their men killed, the dope\\nsmoking, the war-as-being-high aesthetic etc) known to man. He\\'d direct\\nthe superior \"Born on the Fourth of July\" some years later.6/10 \\x96 An ingratiating film, rewarding in a very superficial way. See\\n\"The Quiet American\", \"Walker\", Pontecorvo\\'s \"Burn\" and \"Go Tell the\\nSpartans\".\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThe Vietnam War. From March 1965 to April 1975. Technically. They\\nsigned a Peace Treaty in January 1973 but the fighting continued until\\nAugust 1973. The last US troops left in 1975. This film, Platoon, is a\\nslice of the Vietnam War. Through the eyes of one film producer. In a\\nway I think that Hollywood has never really talked much about the\\n\\'whats and the wherefores\\' of that particular war, in any of its\\nfilms-even in the iconic 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Which is the best of\\nthe bunch of Vietnam War movies. In Platoon you get a fairly\\npredictable depiction of soldiers who would rather be partying,\\nstruggling through hip deep swamps and cutting their way through dense\\npacked jungle-hunted at all times and none too happy about it. None of\\nthe films about Vietnam mentions the ongoing US space program that just\\nhappened to happen at the exact same time as the Vietnam War. I\\nwouldn\\'t be impressed with the space program if I was lying down in\\nmud, in the rain, in clothes that haven\\'t been washed for a month, in\\norder to avoid getting my head blown off by a bunch of people I\\'d never\\nlaid eyes on before, in a country I never had any interest in. I think\\nthe feelings of patriotism that followed the initial US decision to\\nenter into a ground war in Vietnam in 1965 faded rapidly when the\\nbodies stated coming home. By the thousands. This movie is a slice of\\nlife during the Vietnam War but its conspicuous avoidance of mentioning\\nthe ongoing US space program-which would have been on peoples minds-is\\n\\'selective memory\\' on the part of the scriptwriting. It wasn\\'t \"that\\nbad\"-it was \\'very much worse\\', in my humble opinion. Few haven\\'t seen\\nthis film by now.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nI am very interested about wars and the movies about them and I must\\nsay I had pretty high expectations for Platoon. I was hoping that this\\nwould be the ultimate Vietnam-war movie, with all that it takes, with a\\nmature yet challenging view of the reality of war. Well\\x85it wasn\\'t bad but I definitely expected more.My first sensation after I finished watching was this sense of\\nsurprise. I actually can\\'t say I have learned anything new from\\nPlatoon. It struck me as a too predictable and due to that not very\\nconvincing. Yeah, I knew people were killed in wars, I knew that there\\nwere atrocities, I knew some were accepting them and some weren\\'t- what\\nI lacked was some kind of higher self-consciousness of the characters,\\nsome above-average assessment and assimilation of the things, because\\nthis movie seemed like a bunch of robot guys acting, doing the first\\nthing that came into their minds, everything happening exactly the way\\nyou think it would.This takes me to my second point- I really felt that some of the\\n\"explanations\", or ideas were stereotypes or lacked substance. Like the\\nletter in the beginning: with \"this place feels like hell\", or with the\\nlines about duty for your country\\x85I don\\'t know, I\\'m no veteran, but\\nthis doesn\\'t sound very realistic to me. What was again very freak,\\nBunny killing that guy, or Barnes shooting the woman- it is supposed to\\nshow the degrading effects of war, but I can\\'t look to it just like\\nthat. Those guys, especially Bunny, would have probably been psychos\\noutside the war; their attitude is not one war can explain, it\\'s a lot\\nsicker than that. OK, we can understand that war brings out the worst\\nin a human being or that it offers the place for otherwise restrained\\nsick behaviors - yet as an other commenter on IMDb put it, too many\\nthings happen to that small platoon in a very short period. Of course\\nmovie time is limited, but this way we might get the wrong idea about\\nthat war.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThis still is the best and most powerful and gritty Vietnam war movie\\naround.It\\'s a war movie that shocks and confronts not necessarily with its\\ngraphic images but more with its psychological elements. It shows what\\na war can do to common man and how it can make and break characters. So\\nabove everything, \"Platoon\" is really a character movie that tells the\\nstory of two different sergeants who clash and a young recruit being in\\nthe middle of it all.The movie shows the duality of men and isn\\'t afraid to show the dark\\nside of every person. It makes the movie confronting and effective to\\nwatch.While watching this movie it makes a realize that it\\'s a movie that\\nonly could had been made by a Vietnam veteran. The small little details\\nsuch as of the atmosphere and characterize behavior are too detailed\\nand uncompromising to have been written by someone who hasn\\'t been even\\nclose to Vietnam. \"Platoon\" is a sort of autobiography movie by Oliver\\nStone, who put some his own Vietnam war experiences into this movie.\\nThe movie, like basically every Oliver Stone movie, handles\\ncontroversial subjects and is very straightforward, without really\\npicking any sides.The movie features only 2 or 4 real visual confronting sequences. The\\nmovie doesn\\'t need anymore than that to be powerful, or to try and make\\nits point. It lets the psychological elements take of that instead. It\\nmakes \"Platoon\" a movie that doesn\\'t try to impress but nevertheless\\nleaves a powerful and lasting impression through its way of\\nfilm-making. It also provides the movie with some really powerful\\nsequences, with of course the death of Sgt. Elias Grodin as the most\\nclassic and memorable one. I still regard it as the greatest death\\nsequence out of movie history, even though it\\'s completely\\nover-the-top.The movie is mostly carried by the characters that are in it. None of\\nthem are really formulaic or predictable and they are being played by\\nsome great actors. This movie features some great casting, with lots of\\nactors that later became huge stars, such as Forest Whitaker, John C.\\nMcGinley and of course Johnny Depp. Charlie Sheen does a good job at\\nplaying the character, trough whose eyes the entire story gets told.\\nBut it are Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe who really form the movie. In\\na non-formulaic way they represent good and evil.\"Platoon\" is luckily not only just a psychological powerful movie with\\ngreat characters but also visually a great movie to watch. The battle\\nsequences are effective and impressive to watch and really give you a\\nsense of how it must have been like over there, as does the entire\\nmovie by the way. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is wonderful\\nand the Academy Award winning directing by Oliver Stone is just great.\"Platoon\" is of course also the movie that got Adagio for Strings\\neternal fame. The piece of classical music it features prominently the\\nmovie its most important sequences.

       " u\"\\nWillem Dafoe is outstanding in this film as he usually is in most of\\nthe work he has done. Forrest Whittaker, Kevin Dillon and Johnny Depp\\nare enjoyable to watch as well simply because they are so darn young. I\\nhave read about the war in Vietnam extensively and according to friends\\nof mine who served in that war Platoon gives the best depiction of the\\nenvironment, uniforms, customs etc... of the time. Unfortunately,\\nalthough Stone had a lot of the right ingredients to make a war film\\nclassic including funding and personal experience, he fell short in my\\nopinion due to the final scenes of the film. As he so often does,\\nOliver Stone touched on a serious issue but did not have the guts to\\ndelve into it as he did in Born on the Fourth of July. The scenes\\nreminiscent to the public of the My Lai massacre are sugar coated.\\nSheens character somehow turns from being a sniveling preppie private\\ninto a VC killing Captain America by the end of the movie. While I'm\\nsure there have been cases of extreme heroism such as that,I felt the\\nway the character metamorphed into a larger then life hollywoodesque\\nRambo was extremely unbelievable. It took away from the momentum of the\\nfilm. It probably would have been better to kill off Sheen because in\\nreality that is what would have happened. Anyway, I respect Stone for\\nhis politics and for well, some of his films anyway Alexander and Any\\nGiven Sunday excluded, but if only he had stuck to his guts and made a\\nwar movie with a little more realism then Platoon would most certainly\\nbe a great war film classic.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nI saw this one years after it was made and the biggest imprint on me\\nwas making me feel depressed after watching how the men struggled to\\nkeep their sanity in a war that made no sense to anyone at the time.CHARLIE SHEEN is excellent as the college youth whose innocence about\\nman's inhumanity to man gradually changes during the course of ground\\ncombat in the jungles of Vietnam; and WILLIAM DAFOE and TOM BERENGER\\nexcel as two Marine sergeants who oppose each other (hate is a better\\nword) with Berenger being the brutal bully and Dafoe representing a\\nsaner approach.Oliver Stone won his Best Picture/Best Director award and it's easy to\\nsee why. He kept the film's narrow focus on the men and the struggle\\nthey all have for survival under brutal circumstances. Missing are the\\nstereotyped war buddies so commonly seen in the '40s films (the guy\\nfrom Brooklyn, the dumb newbie, the baby-faced Marine) and instead we\\nhave more realistic characters facing a relatively unseen enemy hidden\\nin the thick brush and using the kind of profane language servicemen\\ncommonly do whether in wartime or peace.It's quite an achievement in capturing all the ugliness of war up close\\nand personal--but clearly not a film for everyone. And because it\\ndoesn't paint a rosy picture of America at war, it can be particularly\\ndepressing to watch at this time. Another possible flaw is that it has\\nno clearly discernible plot and you're left constantly wondering where\\nthe whole story is going.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\n\"Everybody\\'s gotta die some day, Red.\"\\nSgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger), \"Platoon.\"I do not believe that there has been a more effective Vietnam War film than\\n\"Platoon.\" Of course, one could argue that Francis Ford Coppola\\'s 1979\\nmasterpiece \"Apocalypse Now\" is the definitive Vietnam picture, but that\\nperson would be quite wrong, as the latter film is not a Vietnam War film\\nbut rather a film taking place in the Vietnam War -- it\\'s based on the novel\\nby Joseph Conrad, \"The Heart of Darkness,\" which I have indeed read and I\\nbelieve was written during the late 1800s. Before the Vietnam War. The\\nVietnam War was used as a setting in the film simply because it was current\\nwith the times. The Vietnam War was the nation\\'s primary focus during the\\n70s. Nowadays the novel would most likely not even take place during a war,\\nbut rather be a story of an African trader journeying up the Congo to find a\\nsecluded man named Kurtz, which is essentially what the book was about in\\nthe first place.No, \"Platoon\" is all about the Vietnam War and the side effects. We get to\\nsee the men before and after, as they gear up and prepare themselves for the\\ndreaded hike through the jungles of Vietnam and into the heart of battle,\\nand when they are finally through with the war and ready to go\\nhome.The film\\'s point of view comes from a young American soldier named Chris\\nTaylor (Charlie Sheen), a rich kid who has joined the war in an effort to\\nappreciate multi-ethnic races and give something back instead of sitting\\naround watching from the outside like all the other rich\\nfolk.His platoon has two Sergeants, Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem\\nDafoe), the former of whom is a hard-nosed macho man ready to tear apart\\nanything in his path and the latter of whom is an experienced soldier who\\ncame into the war with a sense of adventure and has now come to appreciate\\nthe fine things in life, and, for that matter, life itself. Chris forms a\\nclose friendship with Elias, put to a tragic end after Barnes murders Elias\\nin cold blood, an attempt to keep the hounds off of his back after a savage\\nattack on an innocent little farming town in Vietnam, of which Elias is able\\nto testify to.Chris knows Barnes shot Elias, and he tries to form an alliance with a band\\nof other soldiers to help him take out Barnes before more people end up\\ndead. During a savage final attack for the platoon in Vietnam, Barnes tries\\nto murder Chris - but events don\\'t always turn out the way you have them\\nplanned.I don\\'t know a whole lot about the Vietnam War. The history of it all has\\nbeen contorted over the years by Hollywood and sympathizers. It\\'s been made\\nout to be the most brutal and disturbing war of all time, and I believe this\\nmight be true. Why? Because back in the early 40s, at the rise of World War\\nII, the nation was not as angry as it was in the 70s. The 60s had created a\\ndecade of love and peace, and the 70s were the aftereffect of it all. People\\nwere angry. They took their vengeance out in many ways. Vietnam was one of\\nthem. I think it disturbed many people because of the ferocity of it all.The ferocity shines through in a truly disturbing scene, when Chris\\' platoon\\nvisits a local Vietnamese village and Bunny (Kevin Dillon) mercilessly\\nattacks a disfigured man and his mother, some other soldiers attempt to rape\\na young girl (Chris stops them), Barnes shoots a woman, and they burn down\\nthe village.Oliver Stone is a great director whose films have been criticized for\\nhistorical pervasion over the years. He directed \"JFK\" (1991), which caused\\nupset among the people who knew his facts were all incorrect. He then\\ndirected the Quentin Tarantino-scripted \"Natural Born Killers,\" which caused\\nonly more outrage. Many of his films have caused outrage, come to think of\\nit. But I don\\'t think that anyone can deny the power of\\n\"Platoon.\"The film\\'s Military advisor was Capt. Dale Dye, who has worked with Stone on\\nnumerous films and provides a commentary track on the newly-released Special\\nEdition DVD. It\\'s interesting to listen to -- he provides some insight into\\nwhat went on during production, such as how the cast was shipped out to a\\nboot camp to train for the movie.The film has an all-star supporting cast, including Forest Whitaker,\\nFrancesco Quin, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Reggie Miller and Jack\\nSparrow himself, Johnny Depp. They all help make the film what it is. But it\\ntruly comes down to the triangle of Barnes, Elias and Taylor.

       " u\"\\n\\nThis is the movie that sets the standard for the war flicks that followed.\\nThis is Oliver Stone's Oscar winning account of a young man's tour of duty\\nnear the Cambodian border, circa 1967.

       " u\"\\n\\nThis movie seems to tear your heart out.  \\nIf you try watching the key scenes some time\\nwith the sound turned down, you realize that\\nit's a run-of-the-mill war movie.  Stone's\\ndirection is excellent, as always, but his\\ngreatest inspiration was to play Samuel \\nBarber's Adagio for Strings during the scenes\\nof battle and carnage.  The music is what\\ntears your heart out.  Without it, you're\\nleft with a well-crafted movie based on\\nmediocre material.  I credit Stone with using\\nBarber's music to such devastating effect.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nPlatoon puts films like 'We Were Soldiers' 'Tears of the Sun' and\\n'Windtalkers' to shame. And considering Platoon isn't the best war film\\nof all time, or even excellent, that is saying a lot.But I'm not writing this review to blaspheme those films. I'm writing\\nto inform; and, if you are willing to view this film, information is\\nrequired. OK, no: Platoon is not the best war film ever made, or even\\nclose. But what it lacks it just about makes up for, with a great\\nscript, superb performances from anybody involved and a very emotive\\nanti-war message (for part of the film, anyway).Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is a newcomer to the war. Living a\\nreasonably middle class life, he joined up, seeing as he was\\n'educated', to defy expectations of his parents. But he gets more than\\nhe bargained for as early as the first week, and that's not even the\\nhalf of it.It takes a while for all the real atrocities to appear, but when they\\ndo, they really are atrocious. Particularly in a gut-wrenching scene\\nwhere a man's face is literally reduced to pulp by the end of a gun.It isn't perfect, however, no matter how ambitious; despite all of the\\nabove, I still think a deeper insight was completely necessary. This\\nfilm being little less than two hours with the amount of explosions\\nthat there were proves my point. And if not a little short lived, this\\nfilm can't really decide what it wants to be; sure, it shows all the\\nhorrible things in war, but rather contradicts itself; in the end\\nscene, you realise this film is just as much pro as against. This\\nreally does take away some of the effect.However, at least it isn't sentimental. The sad music does occasionally\\nappear to frequently and in the wrong places, but that can be forgiven.\\nOne question to end though: will I remember Platoon? Despite the\\noccasional brilliance and truly powerful scenes, I cannot be sure. If\\nyou asked me that about another war film, 'Saving Private Ryan' the\\nanswer was a definite yes. The difference is obvious.8 out of 10\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThe first hour of \"Platoon\" is so poorly written I thought this was\\ngoing to destroy the entire picture. It is the most basic humanist\\nstory imaginable that a little snot like myself who has never fought in\\nwar could have predicted that the message of the film would be \"War is\\nhell\" yadda yadda yadda Charlie Sheen is so unconvincing. I like how\\nStone chose to show his growth as a person and a soldier in the span of\\nfive minutes:Sheen cruelly shoots at the feet of the one- legged civilian boy making\\nhim dance. Less than five minutes later he walks up a hill to see\\nplatoon men raping a civilian and suddenly he\\'s mister humanitarian.\\n\"She\\'s a human being man\" yeah OK mr. humanitarian.The drug use in the film was portrayed as playful and cool rather than\\nthe cheap escape it actually was. Also Stone paints the good and evil\\nlines so obviously apart that there is no conflict for hearts and\\nminds. War is about good and evil not good versus evil. The Vietnam war\\nis a prime example of that.On the upside however, willem dafoe was great as elias barns monologue\\non death was compelling and the closing battle sequence was the best\\ndepicted chaos of the Vietnam war. Probably more realistic than the\\norder and battle lines depicted in most Vietnam films. However if you\\nwanna a great film that says something more than \"war is hell\" check\\nout Full Metal Jacket the best Vietnam film of the bunch. Overall not\\nbad the second half of Platoon is better than the by-the-numbers first\\nhalf. 6 out of 10\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThis movie addresses the audience on many levels, and as a result has to be\\njudged on a few different levels, if we are to give it an accurate\\nrating.The the basic movie, viewed simply on its own merits with no outside\\nknowledge, is fairly standard fair for a war movie.  The special effects\\nare\\nso-so and a product of their times, the acting is sometimes good (Willem\\nDefoe), and sometimes bad (most of the background characters).  I thought\\nthe dialogue was somewhat less than realistic in a lot of cases, but the\\nmovie keeps things moving and holds your attention, so I give it a 7/10 on\\npurely technical merits.If movies were simply judged on technical merits, we could stop here, but\\nthis film strives to go beyond pure entertainment and teach a bit of a\\nlesson, and there is where I think it both shines and stumbles.  The moral\\nis pretty in your face, war is foolish, war sucks, war is hell...  And\\nStone\\ncertainly makes it appear that way, constantly putting his protagonist in\\nthe position to make ethical judgements even the Pope would have a tough\\ntime with.  My main problem here is that Stone really hits you over the\\nhead\\nwith the message, and he doesn\\'t really try to be even handed at all with\\nthe conflicts the troops faced.  For instance, in the village scene which\\nis\\nso obviously a reference to My Lai, the camera dwells on the US troops\\nbeating the Vietnamese, but not much attention is given to the deaths of\\nthe\\nUS soldiers in the previous sequence of events... they die, but because\\nthere really isn\\'t time to develop all the characters, there\\'s not as much\\nof an emotional attachment to them... combine that with the (commendably)\\nsympathetic way the Vietnamese are portrayed, and it\\'s hard to fathom the\\nmotives of the US troops... they just look like monsters that are randomly\\nshooting Vietnamese women for fun, and yet that\\'s clearly a simplification\\nof the situation, and Stone has to know that, so therefore my feeling is he\\ndeliberately biased the shot.  That\\'s his call, but my feeling is that with\\nan issue this serious, you shouldn\\'t take the easy way out.  Propoganda is\\nbad no matter which side it\\'s coming from.  On the moral/ethical message,\\nI\\'d give the film a 5.5/10... the film\\'s heart is in the right place, but\\nit\\ngets lost in translation sometimes.Last but not least, I have some serious issues with the historical accuracy\\nof the whole film.  As other readers have mentioned, the likelihood of one\\nplatoon facing this many problems in the course of a tour of duty in\\nVietnam\\nwas slim to none...  While I have no problem with Stone taking some\\nartistic\\nliberty to get his point across, I am disturbed at the emphasis everyone\\nplaces on \"Stone was there, so he must know what it was like.\"  I don\\'t buy\\nthat argument - to have a real picture of what\\'s going on, you have to have\\nsome distance from the facts or personal bias will get in the way (as I\\nthink it does in this case).  Anyone who\\'s ever played football knows what\\nI\\nmean...  any individual player (other than the quarterback) knows a little\\nbit of what\\'s happening, but doesn\\'t really have any concept of the broad\\nscope of the play.  Same goes for war.  Troops do what they\\'re told, they\\ndon\\'t get briefs on broad strategy.  Some might say that\\'s a shortcoming of\\nthe system, and they might be right, but it\\'s how it is...  If Stone based\\nthis movie entirely on his personal experience, then it\\'s bound to be\\nbiased, short sited, and most likely factually innacurate, because of the\\nfaults of memory and lack of broad strategic knowledge - and if Stone went\\noutside his experiences to make the movie, then his word can\\'t be taken as\\ngospel, like some would.  Warning, tangent :) - Anyone that\\'s read \"The Red\\nBadge of Courage\" knows that it\\'s an excellent book and appears to be\\ntotally realistic.  Everyone that reads it assumes its author fought in a\\nwar... but he didn\\'t.  He just did extensive interviews with many, many\\nveterans of that war and others.  End tangent :).  On historical accuracy,\\nI\\'d rate the movie at about a 6.  It caught the mood of the times, for\\nsure,\\nbut it wasn\\'t very balanced, and sometimes it pushes the limits of history\\nto try to make its points and maintain the mood.Overall I give the film a 6.25/10.  It was a good, solid movie, but the low\\nbudget and mediocre script/directing kept it from really becoming a\\nclassic.\\nUnlike Apocolypse Now or Full Metal Jacket, I think this will just be a\\nonce-watched movie...  now that I\\'ve seen it, I don\\'t think I need to\\nagain.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nPlatoon did not impress me as a particularly good movie but neither was it a\\nbad movie. On this basis I would rate it 5 out of 10. While it probably depicted the gross nastiness of that awful war pretty\\naccurately in a technical sense, Platoon never transcends itself into a\\nsense of reality. I was always aware I was watching a movie; it never got\\nbeyond the screen to become an experience I got drawn in\\nto.The same goes for the production itself. While it had special effects\\ngalore, to me the action was just a lot of those expensive but not\\nconvincing effects. Again, the would-be horrific scenes never transcended\\nthe screen and gripped me. I was always quite aware that I was watching a\\nmovie production.On the plus side the character development of several of key players was\\nvery interesting and probably the one high point of this movie. The\\ninterplay, the breaking under ultimate stress, etc, were all situations well\\nportrayed. (For this reason I raised my vote from 5 to 6 out of\\n10.)As for the acting, I did not think there was anything outstanding about\\nanyone's performance; everyone was OK.As for the theme, to me the whole movie was like a sick orgy. And while this\\nmay have been what it is supposed to have portrayed, once again, it never\\nconvinced me it was not just a bunch of actors, putting on a very well\\nstaged sick orgy in front of a camera. This all impressed me but it did not\\nmove me.This film is an average grade B war movie with a good moralistic message but\\nwithout much depth. It should appeal to people who like to watch bloody\\nlooking action-packed movies - and perhaps analyze the character portrayals,\\nwithout risking getting too upset.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\nFilmmakers have a huge responsibility when making historical films, as\\ntheir\\nfilm is all most viewers will see on that period or event, and it can\\nshape\\nthe viewers perception of it. In Platoon, Oliver Stone tackled the subject\\nof the Vietnam War, and by saying his film was autobiographical ensured\\nmore\\npeople took it as the gospel truth on what really happened in Vietnam.\\nActually, it has been proved that he did not experience many of the events\\nof the film, such as the village incident. The biggest inaccuracy of this\\nfilm is the fact that everything befalling this one platoon would not,\\ncould\\nnot and did not happen in the time span of this film. During nearly all\\npatrols in reality the enemy was hardly ever seen or heard. The biggest\\nproblem an ordinary GI would face was boredom. Also, contrary to what\\nStone\\nwould like everyone to think, not everyone in Vietnam was a drunk or\\ndoper.\\nIn addition, I find it hard to believe that Chris Taylor would write home\\nto\\nhis grandmother such truths as \"Somebody once wrote: Hell is the\\nimpossibility of reason. That\\'s what this place feels like: Hell.\"\\nLikewise,\\nhis voiceover at the end commenting that his platoon\\'s biggest problem was\\nfighting itself, was a little simplistic, especially in view of the bodies\\nof the final battle and other enemy encounters.The absence of a real plot did not seem to me to matter, as Stone was just\\ntrying to show what it was like in Vietnam, even if he did try to rewrite\\nhistory, rather than tell a story. There were some good elements to the\\nfilm\\napart from the fact that it was good viewing to watch; these included its\\njungle scenes and combat sequences and the fact that the GI uniform,\\nliving\\nconditions, age, language and equipment was accurately portrayed. I also\\nenjoyed the acting and became drawn into the conflict between Elias and\\nBarnes.

I don\\'t think it was the best (I\\nam partial to \"Raging Bull\"), but \"Platoon\" is easily in the top five\\nof that decade. Writer-director Oliver Stone\\'s experiences in Vietnam\\nwere the catalysts for this amazing masterpiece which won four Oscars\\nin 1986, including the Best Picture of the year. Young Charlie Sheen\\nexperiences a year of hell as he witnesses atrocities and learns\\nfirst-hand that innocence is the initial casualty of warfare. At the\\nheart of \"Platoon\" is the conflict between veteran sergeants Tom\\nBerenger and Willem Dafoe (both Oscar-nominated). Berenger is crazed\\nand has distorted views about war. His twisted views will lead to\\nconflict with peaceful and deep-thinking Willem Dafoe who acts as the\\nvoice of reason in a time and place of total chaos. Sheen, Berenger and\\nDafoe all have the best performances to date. They are solid in every\\nway imaginable. Familiar faces like John C. McGinley, Keith David,\\nJohnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon and Tony Todd are all\\nperfect in limited, but important screen time.

       " u'\\n\"It\\'s a lovely f***ing war.\" This acts as the true repudiation of all\\nof the Gung-ho Ra-Ra \"we\\'re gonna win this time\" action films of the\\n1980\\'s, but it also gets to have it\\'s cake and eat it by being a\\nmuscular, hardcore damn (and damning) action picture, photographed by\\nRobert Richardson in the days when he was still coming off being a\\ndocumentary cameraman and before he got into his spotlights. It\\'s Full\\nMetal Oliver Stone, so much of what he was as a young \\'grunt\\' in the\\n\\'s***\\' that was Vietnam but also what he was in the intervening years\\n(it took him a while to figure out what kind of movie it was, about 7\\nyears after he left he wrote a first draft, another 10 years until it\\ngot made).I don\\'t know if necessarily Stone had Rambo and the Chuck Norris pieces\\nof crap or all those other movies where people were returning to\\nVietnam to \"win again\", to fulfill some kind of vision that America\\ndidn\\'t really *lose*, but there are two aspects of this movie that do a\\nwonderful job of giving the middle finger to the military industrial\\ncomplex and even military movies: Tom Berenger\\'s hard-ass Sgt. Barnes,\\nwho gets s**t done and is a tough motherf****r, but also shirks\\nresponsibility for his rage and in killing innocents in full view of\\nothers and cold blood (maybe a minor plot-gap - sure Elias might stir\\nhell up and report him, but even if he\\'s gone no one else would speak\\nup about a, you know *Court Martial*-able crime? oh well, I\\'ll let it\\ngo I guess), and yet you completely understand who he is and what he\\'s\\ndoing, why even if he is a true antagonist in his brutality he\\'s human\\nin his monstrosity, if that makes sense (see how he chugs Jack Daniels\\nwhen he makes his \\'I s*** on all of you\\' entrance to the other grunts\\ntalking about whether to take him out or not).The other aspect is the climax; this is one of those major,\\nhyper-realistic and hyper-violent and intense action set pieces with\\nlots of gunfire and explosions and chaos, but a) you can understand\\neverything going on (it\\'d be nice to show this sequence to action\\neditors and directors today), and more important b) the Americans lose.\\nThe VC take over the military camp and the whole perimeter, and there\\'s\\nno choice but to call in the planes to drop some bombs on the area. It\\nshouldn\\'t be overlooked: the Americans *lose*, which encapsulates the\\nmessage of the movie. Of course there were war movies before that\\ndidn\\'t celebrate one side or the other - All Quiet on the Western\\nFront, Paths of Glory - but a lot of those films were exceptions.Though Full Metal Jacket came out a mere six months later - a\\ncoincidence I\\'m sure - many other movies, great ones, came out due to\\nthis one being released (Casualties of War being the most notable to\\nme, but also Stone\\'s other war pictures; oddly enough he wanted to also\\nmake Born on the 4th of July years before and only Platoon made it\\npossible). I don\\'t even know if it\\'s his best or my personal favorite,\\nbut it certainly shows a filmmaker screaming out his concerns and\\npassions as an artist about a place and time that is also meant to\\nstretch beyond this war and to others; when Sheen gives that on the\\nsurface preachy narration at the end about \"we didn\\'t fight the enemy,\\nwe fought ourselves,\" it can be spread out into other wars, other times\\npeople who thought they were in the right, the Barnes and Rambos,\\ndidn\\'t see the BS (or accepted it, said \\'screw it\\' with a giant machine\\ngun).Last note: Willem Dafoe\\'s Jesus pose makes for a helluva poster, but in\\nthe context of the scene it\\'s in... is it earned? There\\'s enough\\noperatic-horrors going on, which is fine, but it comes off as a bit\\nmuch. But it\\'s Dafoe so, I dunno, he\\'s awesome.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n...with the majority of people commenting on this film. It is described\\nby many as:- one of the best (if not the best) film on war ever made,- better than Apocalypse NowFor the first point, I am pretty sure than a lot of better things have\\nbeen done on war; for the second point, I am on the edge of crying when\\nthinking that some people dare compare it to Apocalypse Now !...But let\\'s not start a flame war. To comment on it, first the director\\ncould have made more of some parts of the movie. The tensions between\\nthe members of the platoon could have been exploited much better. The\\nmain character (Taylor) could have used a far sharper depiction. The\\nwar scenes are better, quite realistic. But the scenes describing the\\n\"abuses of war\" seemed really gratuitous.The acting is good. I really liked some of the second parts (Keith\\nDavid for example). But the main ones deserve little praise. I am\\npretty sure that Charlie Sheen had the leading part on the only basis\\nof his being the descendant of the much more convincing leading actor\\nof Apocalypse Now. Even the use of him as the voice off smells like a\\n\"r\\xe9chauff\\xe9\" of Coppola\\'s masterpiece. Dafoe is not very convincing,\\nwhich is all the more regrettable that his part was important in the\\n\"propos\" of the film.Concerning the sound track, I will only say that it is typically\\nHollywoodian.I was maybe a little severe due to my expectations, since I had read\\nsome of the comments on IMDb before watching it. I should maybe replace\\nit in the context of the time when it was released (cold war,\\ntriumphant Reaganism). I should maybe not try to see it as a film about\\nwar in general, but rather on the specific experience of American\\nsoldiers in Viet N\\xe2m. But even in this case, my rating would not change\\nby much (well, maybe half a star more).Once again (don\\'t think I am being partial, but I was really upset by\\nsome comments on this matter): it CAN NOT be compared to Apocalypse\\nNow. This latter was raising the Viet N\\xe2m war context up to a more\\ngeneralist level, allowing a deep introspection in the implications and\\nnecessities of \"warfare\". Nothing in common with the bits of reflection\\nscattered here and there in Platoon.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI remember watching this film about ten years ago and not being\\nimpressed. I have since been plagued by people insisting that it is the\\ngreatest film of its genre so I decided to watch it again and give it\\nanother chance. My original impressions were correct. Some of the\\nacting in this film is truly awful (John C. McGinley, for example, is\\nconsistently weak throughout). Also there are some serious questions to\\nbe asked of the dialogue. The major problem with the film, however, is\\nthe the plot in general and the characters that are central to it. The\\nblatant juxtaposition of Sgt. Barnes with Sgt. Grodin trivialises the\\natrocities that are committed in war. The gross simplification of the\\nissues by Stone here is actually quite irritating. If one wants to look\\nat a war film that deals with the horrors without being overly\\nsentimental (note Barber's Adagio!) then I would suggest The Deer\\nHunter.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n... I figure that Stone must have been smoking some of the same grass\\nthat the characters do in this movie to end up with a product like\\nthis. Sure, it's beautifully filmed, but really, all it is when you\\ncome right down to it is a bunch of Americans sitting around, getting\\ndrunk and stoned, and talking bull. Occasionally something actually\\nhappens/explodes, but then Stone goes into hyperactive camera mode. It\\nmight be authentic from the perspective that none of the troops knew\\nwhat was going on either; but it's frustrating for an audience member\\ntrying to piece together some sense from this garbled mosaic that says\\n'War is hell!' in between long pulls on a 'J'.None of the cast are particular standouts either, ranging from 'going\\nthrough the motions' to pitifully bad.It is rare that I have had to endure such a boring experience from an\\notherwise regarded classic. It is beyond me how this won so many awards\\nand so much acclaim.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThe acting by Dafoe and Beringer was top notch. However, while this movie\\nfairly accurately portrayed the day-to-day miserable conditions under\\nwhich\\nan infantryman fought in Vietnam (or any war), most of the plot is largely\\nsymbolic:  \"good seargent\" (Elias) versus \"evil seargent\"(Barnes) who are\\n\"fighting for the soul\" of FNG Chris Taylor (Sheen).  The depiction of the\\nsquad on night ambush, trying to stay awake in the rain after humping the\\nbush all day--truly a realistically miserable portrayal.  But Sheen\\'s\\nlater\\nsavvy, getting out of the bunker just before an RPG hits it, was\\nuncharacteristic of his character.  His spectacular one-man charge at the\\nNVA in the middle of the firefight would have realistically gotten him\\nkilled.  Sheen\\'s background narration often verged on the corny and\\nderisive, such as in describing the rest of the platoon: \"They were\\nsociety\\'s losers, Grandma--the bottom of the barrel\" (or words to that\\neffect), and does a disservice to Vietnam infantrymen.  It also repeats\\nthe\\nold stereotype that only young draftees fought the war and died there (not\\ntrue!).  The village \"massacre scene\" was just Stone\\'s grinding his own\\npolitical axe.  Such events were truly rare or we would have much more\\ndocumentation on them. Read the book \"Platoon: Bravo Company\", by Robert\\nHemphill, the real commander of the unit portrayed in Platoon.  A somewhat\\ndifferent perspective than that portrayed by Stone.  I speak from\\nexperience, as an infantry veteran of the Vietnam War.\\n',\n",

At the time, it was notable for its authenticity in depicting the\\nlife of a Vietnam grunt, and I certainly want to be sensitive to anyone\\nwho served in Vietnam and has an appreciation for this movie because of\\nit. But the movie itself is hopelessly overwrought and reeks of Stone\\'s\\nsledgehammer style of film-making. He can\\'t allow emotions to speak for\\nthemselves, so he asks slow motion shots and thundering music to do the\\nwork instead. And there was enough material for a movie about Vietnam\\nalready without his having to concoct the ridiculous rivalry plot he\\ncooks up for Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe to play out, both of them\\nseemingly transplanted straight from the jungles of \"Apocalypse Now\".Every time I hear that classical composition that plays over and over\\nand over in this film I want to jab a fork into my eye.Grade: C+\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nWhen I first saw 'Platoon' in December of 1986 (less than a week after\\nit opened) my reaction was more or less typical, and likely swayed by\\npopular opinion at the time...No politics, no apologies: just a blood and guts version of the Vietnam\\nWar as seen from a soldier's point of view, written and directed by one\\nwho was there. Oliver Stone's previous writing credits ('Midnight\\nExpress', 'Scarface', 'Year of the Dragon') showed an almost obsessive\\ninclination toward melodramatic bloodletting, but here at least he\\nfound the perfect vehicle for his sweaty daydreams. The film is a\\nsoldier's act of public catharsis: a dramatized but painfully vivid\\naccount of one young grunt's transfiguration from eager, innocent\\nrecruit to brutalized, savage veteran, driven by his horror, fear, and\\nfatigue into acts of violence against both his enemies and his\\ncomrades.Some of the details may be exaggerated out of all proportion (Tom\\nBerenger's cruelly scared face; the stately Barber adagio on the\\nsoundtrack), but the overall effect works not unlike a swift blow to\\nthe stomach: not exactly an enjoyable experience, but the pain is hard\\nto forget.Six months later, after seeing the film a second time (it was still\\nscreening at first-run theaters in San Francisco), my response was more\\ncircumspect...after all the Oscars were awarded and all the hype and\\nhysteria quieted down, it became easier to appreciate Oliver Stone's\\ncareer making war movie for what it really was: not the best film made\\nof the Vietnam experience, but certainly the most timely and\\naccessible.There's no doubting the necessity or sincerity of Stone's vision. Or\\nthe grim accuracy of his details (drawn no doubt from his own memories\\nof combat). But as a filmmaker he is, at best, more a skilled craftsman\\nthan an artist, and his claustrophobic grunt's-eye view of the war\\ncan't help but suffer from a foot soldier's single-minded lack of\\nimagination, simplifying complex moral dilemmas into obvious and easy\\npersonifications of good versus evil: saintly Willem Dafoe vs.\\nbattle-scarred Tom Berenger.The only way Stone can think to take up the narrative slack is with\\nunnecessary voice-over narration (letters to grandma, no less), usually\\na last-ditch tactic designed to camouflage a film's inability to\\ncommunicate in its own language.

       " u\"\\n\\nDisillusionment: it can represent an end; herald a beginning; and\\nsometimes, it can do both to some degree.  Are we more than pawns in the\\nbattlefield of life, destined to accept what is generally acknowledged as\\nreality?  In Platoon, writer/director Oliver Stone attempts to tackle this\\nissue with varying degrees of success.  The film follows the exploits of\\nan\\nAmerican military unit during the Vietnam War.  The group is ultimately\\ndivided by two feuding authority figures, Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom\\nBerenger) and Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe).  Caught in the middle is\\nPrivate Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), who is forced to decide where his\\nloyalty lies.  On one hand is Barnes, a driven patriot who is will stop at\\nnothing to achieve his goals.  On the other hand is Elias, a man who no\\nlonger believes in the war but has not lost his compassionate outlook.\\nElias has already realized that the whole war is a lie, and through the\\nfilm\\nTaylor arrives at the same realization.Charlie Sheen gives an excellent portrayal of Taylor, a character loosely\\nbased on Stone.  Taylor is an upper class young man who could have easily\\navoided the war but chose to volunteer.  He wanted to be a hero: following\\nin the footsteps of his grandfather, who fought in World War I, and his\\nfather, a World War II soldier.  Instead, he is trapped in a world where\\nit\\nis impossible to be a hero - where it is difficult to determine who the\\nenemy is.  Stone explores how American soldiers were destined for\\nhardships\\nbefore even setting foot on the Vietnam battlefield.  For example, Taylor\\nlacked sufficient training; he did not know what equipment was necessary\\nto\\ntake on patrols.  After Taylor passes out from overloading his pack, Elias\\nremoves all the unnecessary items.Another issue Stone delineates is how the rampant use of narcotics plagued\\nmany men in Vietnam.  Elias, one of the more respected soldiers, used\\ndrugs\\nliberally.  When Taylor is just beginning to use drugs, there is a segment\\nin which Elias blows smoke through a rifle barrel into Taylor's mouth.\\nWhen\\nthe most influential men in the war not only advocate but partake in such\\nbehavior, what are the impressionable young men supposed to think?  While\\nBarnes does not do drugs, he is an alcoholic.  Therefore, no matter who a\\nsoldier sides with, he is still exposed to the use of deleterious\\nsubstances.Platoon portrays the disappointment of America during the Vietnam War; its\\nbroken heart.  In his journey, Taylor's lose of innocence represents more\\nthan just one man.  He symbolizes every soldier that enters the war with a\\npatriotic soul and leaves with a tarnished one.  His illusions are\\ndestroyed, his youthful optimism eradicated.  Specifically Sheen and Dafoe\\ncomplement this film with moving performances.  On the other hand the\\nwriting was adequate, and the directing. lacking.  Stone's direction of\\nthe\\nbattle scenes was jumbled and confusing, leaving one squinting to\\ndetermine\\nwhat is going on.5 out of 10 stars\\n\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nStone\\'s Platoon certainly has one thing going for it: potential. I just\\nnever thought that it lived up to it. For being a movie about the\\nsecond most morally ambiguous war in American history (WWI being the\\nfirst), it was too cut and dry. The Freudian psyche is blatantly\\nparaded around via DeFoe (superego) and Berenger (id), with Sheen as\\nthe ego. It too overtly says \"this=good\" and \"that=bad.\" Vietam is\\nabout gray, not black and white.Also, it felt very sophomoric. The soldiers\\' swearing seemed more like\\nthey were trying to act tough. They kept saying how everything was\\npolitics, and \"the man\" was tying to keep them down. Perhaps this movie\\nis where we get our mental commercialized image of Vietnam troops, but\\nI thought it was cheesy. The entire cast, especially Charlie Sheen,\\nfelt melodramatic and maudlin. Stone\\'s camera work was decent, but at time it felt jumbled, though\\nthis served the battle scenes well. They were probably the best part of\\nthe movie.My biggest complaint is Elias\\'s death. If he was running when he got\\nshot, why wouldn\\'t he just fall forward? Why kneel and raise your arms\\nto the heavens, then fall sideways? It sure does make a nice box cover.\\nIt\\'s this sort of overly-dramatic sequences that bugged me throughout\\nthe film.Overall, Platoon seemed more like a commercial Hollywood blockbuster\\ncashing in on the war than a mature statement on it. Stanley Kubrick\\'s\\nFull Metal Jacket was released within a year of Platoon, and better\\nshows the dehumanization of war (It\\'s a Jungian thing). Both bow before\\nApocalypse Now, which stars Martin Sheen, Charlie\\'s father, as he is\\nsent to execute Kurtz, who would make Barnes wet his pants. Stone\\nwishes he could be Coppola.Entertaining, but nothing more:C+\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThe focus here is on \\'realism\\', at the expense of the drama and\\ncinema...in fact, all of those values are crushed out by the slavish\\ndevotion to \\'telling it like it was\\'.There are two obliquely related stories; the story set in Vietnam, and\\nSheen\\'s framing narration...they\\'re an honest mismatch, so the two are\\nforcefully melded together, in order to drive home the moralizing tone. Most of this movie is visually unimportant...the only attempt at\\nworthwhile visual narrative is the juxtaposition of Elias\\' (botched)\\ndeath scene against Barnes\\' demonic rage. Conrad\\'s \\'Heart of Darkness\\'\\nis implied (more effectively expounded upon in \"Apocalypse Now\", and of\\ncourse, \"Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes\").How many vets bore such an existential crisis? No matter, this is the\\none that got the most thumbs up from the servicemen. Stone was out to overturn the perspective of things like \"The Green\\nBerets\"; they just weren\\'t real enough...in doing so, he started the\\ntrend of all successive war films (whether about this war or any other)\\nneeding to establish plausibility through tedious attention to detail.So all we get is a morality play, nothing that needs to be displayed on\\nfilm. This was all nicely deflated in Seinfeld\\'s \"The Fatigues\" episode\\n(the overuse of the \\'Adagio\\' theme music).\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nSo much praise for such a preachy film.Let's see, our Vietnam soldiers were baby and wife killers who would even\\nkill each other to cover up their crimes, right?Well, that's what Stone would have you believe in this complete slap to\\nthe\\nface of any real Veteran.While Speilberg and others could show the horror of war while still not\\ninsulting our men/women who served, Stone shows our men as essentially\\nslime.This is not to say there are not parts in the movie that are not well\\ndone.\\nBut as others have noted, this film pales in comparison to other well done\\nfilms.  Plenty of films with the same message (horror of war, evil in men)\\nsuch as Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket tower way above this one.But Stone can't handle subtlety, so he has to beat you over the head with\\nhow truly evil our Amercian soldiers were in his eyes.

       " u'\\n\\nIt\\'s ridiculous to compare Platoon to Saving Private Ryan, and idiotic to\\nsay that the former is better than the latter. Nevertheless, I will compare\\nthe two, if only to counter some of the more ridiculous user comments\\nwritten on this site. Ryan has a far better-written script than Platoon. Its storyline isn\\'t all\\nover the place (Platoon seems to take its group of soldiers and put them\\ninto every single situation faced by Americans in the Vietnam war, which is\\nokay in concept, but not done too well here). Ryan\\'s has a path and moves\\nsmoothly and interestingly from one event to the next.Next: The combat sequences. I consider myself open-minded, but I have to\\nseriously doubt the intelligence of ANYONE who says that in this category,\\nPlatoon is better. It cannot possibly be--Platoon is simply too low-budget.\\nThe visual effects are unconvincing (don\\'t tell me those explosions look\\nreal) and the sound (which won an Oscar!) ranges from tinny to annoying.And what\\'s up with the tiny platoon? When we get to a lot of the combat\\nsequences, there are hardly any soldiers. It\\'s like there\\'s Barnes and a\\nhandful of American privates. For that matter, the problem of not enough\\nsoldiers (was this supposed to be a WAR, or what?) exists on BOTH sides.\\nRyan outmatches Platoon not only in terms of intensity but in terms of scope\\nas well, showing fights between large groups of soldiers, which made it\\nlook... REAL. Platoon makes a false promise to put you in the war. I\\'ve seen\\nstreet gangs with more members.And to anyone who says, \"Oliver Stone was there. He fought in Vietnam. He\\nknows what he\\'s showing,\" just please stop. STOP. All you know is hearsay.\\nJust because someone served in the war doesn\\'t mean they saw everything that\\nhappened in the war, now does it? I guess Oliver didn\\'t know that the\\nVietnamese frequently strapped time bombs to their own children during this\\nwar, then sent them out to American soldiers, who were promptly blown up\\nbecause they couldn\\'t shoot a child.Where am I going with this? Well, a lot of the things that happen in this\\nmovie make no sense, and a lot of people will think they know something and\\nsay Stone must be right--after all, he went through it. No one platoon could\\nhave seen all the events (combat and otherwise) that this one does. It was\\nlike Stone was putting the platoon through the whole war in a week. Stone\\ndidn\\'t see everything that they did. Not by half. The result is that Stone\\nis directing what he DOESN\\'T know, what he DIDN\\'T see, which is, in part,\\nwhy a lot of the movie doesn\\'t make sense. An objective viewer will look at\\nthis movie and see a whole bunch of parts that are just plain stupid. (And\\nthe cinematography\\'s not that great, either)In addition, I\\'m really put off by the fact that this movie makes monsters\\nout of the Americans and heroes and martyrs out of the Vietnamese, showing\\nonly the atrocities committed on our part and none of theirs. Didn\\'t we\\nenter the war because the people portrayed as innocent townspeople (and\\nbadly camouflaged soldiers) invade South Vietnam to put the populace under\\ndictatorial communist control? We came there to save them and WE\\'RE the bad\\nguys? If Stone were making a truly objective film, he\\'d show what crimes the\\nViet Minh and Viet Cong committed against us. This movie isn\\'t anti-war,\\nit\\'s anti-American.On a positive note, the acting is great, the good cast masking the\\ninadequacies of a thinly written script that brings forth every possible\\nkind of conflict with the flimsiest of segues between them. And the music is\\ntruly beautiful, unlike the overall film. I do not lambaste it because it\\'s\\ndisturbing (my favorite movies include Schindler\\'s List and Saving Private\\nRyan), but because it\\'s unconvincing. Best Picture? I wouldn\\'t give this\\nBest Picture over anything short of the 1998 American Godzilla\\nmovie.\\n',\n",

I rooted for the infantrymen, of course, but I\\ndidn\\'t appreciate Stone\\'s (and Hollywood\\'s in general) typical\\nstereotypes of showing a gung-ho solider as the bad guy and the more\\npacifist-type as the good guy.

He really wanted to show, not\\nonly how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic on\\nthose who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to over \"glorify\" this\\naspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne, grand-standing,\\nOscar-hunting \"let\\'s create an enduring image\" for my liking.The problem I have with Stone and other film-makers of his ilk is that\\nthey fail to understand this simply concept: depicting the terribly\\nbloody deadly waste that war is only says that war is bad - which is\\npretty self-evident, isn\\'t it? World War 2 was horrible, incredible\\nwaste of human life, yet a necessary path to take in most people\\'s\\nopinion. It\\'s clear Stone wants to say that the Vietnam war was wrong\\n(which is fine) but argues this point by simply saying it was wrong\\nbecause it was violent and traumatic. If you want to challenge the\\nVietnam war, make a film focusing on how it started rather that 100\\nminutes of people getting blown apart!This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big \"twist\"\\nwas a bit stupid. However, this is not Stones first oddball departure.\\nWall street was a magnificent film, up until the last 30 minutes or so\\nwhen it made a dreadful \"wrong turn.\" JFK is probably one of the few\\nfilms Stone did that actually ended very well.But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up\\nuntil that point of the film to twist around. And this is why i gave it\\nsuch a low mark. It was virtually story-less and ultimately boring -\\nunless you fell for the manufactured poignancy.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI\\'m both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is\\nso\\naccurate about Vietnam, and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie is about as true\\nabout the whole Vietnam war as the Rodney King beating is true about ALL\\npolice officers. Yes, bad things do (and did) happen, but in general the\\npeople there are just like you and me. They have morals, they are not\\nkilling machines, they do not all do drugs. Atrocities were the exception\\nin\\nVietnam, not the rule. They happened far more infrequently than the \"hype\"\\nwould lead you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for making movies that\\nshow\\nthe Vietnam war as this brutal bloodbath, but are based as much in reality\\nas Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do\\nyourself a favour and learn the truth. Fact: the Viet Cong and NVA did far\\nworse things to the South Vietnamese than ANY soldier in the US Armed\\nForces\\never did. Fact: the soldiers in World War II treated the enemy far worse\\nin\\ngeneral than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were WELCOMED when they\\ncame home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve\\nour\\nrespect; though the war was badly fought from a political standpoint, no\\none\\ncould have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great disservice\\nto\\nassert that this kind of \"mostly true\" fiction is the way things really\\nwere\\nthere.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nWhen I watched this, I noticed that \"Best picture winner\" was on the cover. \\nI thought that someone had written this on there as a joke, but upon closer\\nexamination, I realized that it was actually printed on the case. \\nWhy???I never understand why people enjoy this movie.  Probably because it\\'s so\\nrealistic.  Personally, I think it\\'s depressing.  I know that war is\\nactually like this (I\\'m a soldier myself), but this movie just takes that\\nidea way too far.  Best war movie ever go to Pearl Harbor, with Saving\\nPrivate Ryan a close second place.  This one is close to the bottom of my\\nlist.Although this is actually Oliver Stone\\'s best movie.  That should say\\nsomething about all his other films...\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nIgnore everyone who praises this leftist piece of crap. I've talked to\\nmany\\nVietnam veterans, and they all hated the film, denounced its many\\nhistorical\\ninaccuracies and its negative portrayal of them. Here's a hint: Oliver\\nStone\\ndirected the shlock. He's an admirer of Fidel Castro. So, obviously this\\nmovie is loaded with Communist propaganda. Sick, vile, poorly written,\\npoorly made, etc. I could go on all day, but I have better things to do\\nthen\\ncontemplate this terrible film. Avoid it all costs. Most of the men who\\nfought in Vietnam were (with a few exceptions, of course) tough,\\ncourageous,\\nvaliant men who fought honorably. By watching the movie, by praising it,\\nyou\\nare only giving aid and comfort to the murderous Communists who were the\\ntrue villains and butchers of that war.\\n\",\n",
