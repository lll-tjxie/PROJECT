       "[u'\\nI would not argue that there could be better films made before and\\nafter Cabiria. Perhaps. But there never will be another \"Nights of\\nCabiria\" - the last Fellini\\'s film with the linear structure, his third\\nand the most successful collaboration with his actress wife, Giulietta\\nMasina, his immortal love letter to her. Of all his characters, Fellini\\nonce said, Cabiria was the only one he was still worried about. Of all\\nthe characters, I\\'ve seen in the films, Cabiria is the one I often\\nthink about - what ever happened to her? Did she survive? Was she able\\nto find love? I\\'ve never seen the face so alive, changing its expression every\\nmoment. If the face is the soul\\'s mirror, Cabiria\\'s (Masina\\'s) face\\nreflects her every single emotion and how effortlessly she goes from\\nbitter cynicism to wistful yearning, from despair to hope, from tears\\nto smile.

       " u'\\nFederico Fellini, the genius of the Italian cinema left his imprint in\\nall the films he directed for all of us to enjoy forever. \"Le Notti di\\nCabiria\" stands as one of his best because of the character of that\\ninvincible woman at the center of the story: Cabiria! Having recently\\nseen the excellent copy that was shown at NY\\'s Film Forum, this is a\\nfilm that like good wine gets better with age.Fellini was the man whose idea was translated for the screen with his\\nusual collaborators, Tulio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano. Pier Paolo\\nPassolini contributed to some of the dialog. Essentialy, this is a\\ntimeless tale of a woman that despite adversity, bad times, and all\\nthat is wrong around her, keeps her chin up and never begrudges a\\nthing. In fact, Cabiria, despite of her profession, is a woman with a\\nhighly moral character.The film takes us back to another, more innocent era. We are shown a\\nprostitute with a heart of gold who is always cheated by most of the\\nmen who comes in contact with her. Cabiria is never resentful, or\\nbitter at the hand life throws her way.One of the best realized sequences of the film involves Cabiria being\\npicked up by a handsome and popular actor, Alberto Lazzari. Alberto is\\nabout the only one in the movie that treats Cabiria with any semblance\\nof warmth. Unfortunately, nothing happens between them because\\nAlberto\\'s lover, the gorgeous Jessy, arrives at Alberto\\'s apartment to\\nclaim what\\'s hers, leaving Cabiria shut up in a bathroom. If only her\\nfriends could see her then! Nobody would believe it!There is not a moment out of place in the film. Of course, Fellini had\\nthe incomparable Giulietta Masina playing the leading role. Ms. Masina\\nis just too wonderful for words. She makes us believe she is Cabiria,\\nand that\\'s that, which in itself it\\'s something other actresses try\\nharder, without the same results. Ms. Masina\\'s face reveals all that is\\ngoing on within Cabiria. Together with all her other creations in other\\nFellini\\'s films, this is perhaps her own triumph as an actress.Franca Marzi, who plays Cabiria\\'s best friend, is also excellent.\\nAmadeo Nazzari is perfect portraying the matin\\xe9e idol, Alberto Lazzari.\\nThis was one of his best appearances in a distinguished career in the\\nItalian cinema. The rest of the cast is wonderful.Fellini\\'s masterpiece is a film that satisfies any time one sees it\\nthanks to his vision and the presence of Giulietta Masina.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nWhat do I love most about Federico Fellini\\'s wondrous THE NIGHTS OF\\nCABIRIA?I love the opening scenes when Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) is robbed and\\ndumped in the Tiber River, and the bikinied Roman boys jump in to save\\nher, but she is annoyed that they have saved her life because she wants\\nto know what happened to Giorgio, who she thinks ran away because \"he\\nwas scared.\" He\\'s the one who had robbed and nearly drowned her.I love the many nocturnal scenes around the Passeggiata Archeologica in\\nRome where the gargoylish prostitutes, like angelic gargoyle Cabiria\\nherself, are selected by their customers approaching in cars, and the\\nwild and saucy humor that accompanies those scenes, particularly when\\nthey deal with one elephantine hooker named \"Bomba Atomica.\"I love the scene at the religious shrine of Divina Amore, where\\neveryone comes to vociferate their desired favors, and Cabiria pleads\\nto be released from her life as a streetwalker, and the old lame man\\nfalls at the foot of the altar, unhealed. The intensity of the\\nbuild-up, the virtuosic camera work, the faces of the pious, are all\\nbreathtaking.I love the famed scene in the sleazy theatre where Cabiria, at the\\nhands of an unscrupulous hypnotist, relives a tender and poignant scene\\nfrom her youth in front of a crowd of louts.I love the scenes in and around Cabiria\\'s Ostia Road hovel, and the\\nlittle boys who climb giant Jungle Jims and call out her name, and she\\nwaves back.I love Cabiria\\'s friend Wanda (Franca Marzi), whom she loves dearly.\\nShe is a million times less vulnerable that our heroine and takes\\nCabiria\\'s rants with gracious generosity.I love the scene of that night Cabiria spends in the luxurious villa of\\na movie star (Amedeo Nazzari.) She is totally out of her element,\\ndoesn\\'t recognize lobster, cuddles a cute puppy as fragile as she is,\\nbutts her head against unseen doors.I love the deity-kissed music of Nino Rota, lilting us, as it captures\\nthe soul of Fellini\\'s lovely wife, Giulietta/Cabiria. And I love the overwhelming and moving finale, when Cabiria is robbed\\nby water once more, this time by a cruel scammer feigning love and for\\nwhom Cabiria was ready to start life anew. She rises from her anguish,\\nand as she follows the road revelers, turns and smiles to us, to\\nME!\\x85the most eloquent smile in Italian artistic creation since La\\nGioconda.Smile at us, Cabiria, or are you Giulietta Masina smiling now?

       " u'\\n\\nI am not much in favor of \"best\" lists--I wouldn\\'t make\\nit\\nin Cusack\\'s \"High Fidelity\" world--but I can usually offer\\na range of titles of films that I consider the most powerful\\nexperiences I have had in front of a screen--Bicycle Thief,\\nRan, Ordet, Seventh Seal, Citizen Kane, L\\'Avventura, \\nRear Window, Blade Runner, quite a few others.  But if\\nI\\nhad to pick just one title, it would be Nights of Cabiria.\\nI saw it when it first came out in this country--I was\\na junior in high school and fortunate enough to live near\\na theater that showed foreign films.  It ran for several\\nweeks and I kept going back to see it over and over, giving\\nmyself permission by dragging friends to see it.  No one\\nwas\\never disappointed, though only a couple of friends developed\\na comparable enthusiasm with mine. I have continued to seeit every chance I get, though I have not had the opportunity\\nto\\nsee the latest reissue--I probably will have to see it onvideo or dvd, since the city I now live in rarely shows\\nany\\nforeign films.  Giulietta Massina gives not just the greatestperformance of her career, but surely one of the greatestperformances ever recorded on film, and the sequence of\\nCabiria\\'s experiences, at first seemingly random and \\ninsignificant, adds up to one of the most profound statements\\nFellini ever made about human life.  \\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is one of the most perfect films ever committed to celluloid. It\\ninvolved me more than at least 99% of other films I've seen, and the main\\ncharacter, Cabiria, is a character to cherish and love forever (of course,\\nwe who have seen La Strada are already partly familiar with the character).\\nI've hardly ever cared more about a character, and even after only five\\nminutes into the film, I wanted so desperately to protect her. Giulietta\\nMasina is so masterful in her performance, and Federico Fellini, her\\nhusband, is as masterful in his direction. I did not believe that they could\\nmatch their success with La Strada, but, in fact, they succeeded in\\nsurpassing it. Bravo. 10/10. One of the best films ever made, plain and\\nsimple. \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\n\\tA prostitute whose life is a veritable study in the resilience of the human\\nspirit is the subject of `Nights of Cabiria,' directed by Federico Fellini. \\nGiulietta Masina stars as Cabiria, a gentle soul at heart who manages to\\nmaintain a positive outlook even in the face of adversity.  Experiences that\\nwould leave those of lesser mettle jaded she is seemingly able to ward off\\nand emerge from intact, with a guarded optimism that nevertheless leaves her\\nopen to whatever ills life may have in store for her next.  But it is just\\nthat optimism and her sense of joy in the simple things that makes her so\\nendearing.  She is proud, for example, of the fact that she owns her own\\nhouse, hovel though it may be.  Though not one to be easily duped, she is\\nvulnerable to sincere persistence, which has in the past rendered her victim\\nto those who would take advantage of her, which is succinctly established in\\nthe opening scene of the film. \\n\\tFellini's film is a study of how good may succumb to evil, and yet still\\ntriumph in the end (though open to subjective interpretation).  It's\\nsomething of an examination of endurance; how many times can one be knocked\\ndown before finally being unable to stand back up again.  At the same time,\\nhowever, it's an example of how purity can prevail against even the utmost\\ncruelty.  There is a humanity manifested in Cabiria that somehow gives\\nabsolution, not only to her lifestyle, but to those who would willingly do\\nher harm.  And it is in that very same absolution that we find a message of\\nhope and redemption.  \\n\\tAs Cabiria, the diminutive Masina gives a performance that is nothing less\\nthan superlative, filled with nuance and expression.  She has a face and a\\nmanner that convey an unbelievable depth of emotion, and Fellini captures\\nevery bit of it with his camera to perfection.  It sometimes seems that she\\nis a sprite merely masquerading as a woman; she has a light, almost ethereal\\npresence, though at the same time she exhibits an earthy quality that gives\\nher character such complexity, which removes any semblance of stereotype one\\nmay assign to her character as a `lady of the evening.'  It is a heartfelt,\\nmemorable portrayal that quite simply should have earned her an Oscar for\\nBest Actress.  Turning in a noteworthy performance, also, is Francois\\nPerier, as Oscar D'Onofrio, the stranger who comes into Cabiria's life with\\nan offer that ultimately seems too good to be true.\\n\\tThe supporting cast includes Amedeo Nazzari (Alberto Lazzari), Aldo Silvani\\n(The Hypnotist), Franca Marzi (Wanda), Dorian Gray (Jessy), Mario Passante\\n(Cripple in the `Miracle' sequence), Pina Gualandri (Matilda), Leo Cattozzo\\n(Man with the sack) and Polidor (The Monk).  `Nights of Cabiria' is a film\\nof extraordinary depth that is beautiful as well in it's humanity; Fellini\\nhas created images, both visually and emotionally, that are stunning and\\nindelibly realized.  Highlighted by the performance of Giulietta Masina,\\nthis is a film that begs to be embraced, one that will stay with you long\\nafter the last shadow has passed from the screen into darkness.  In Cabiria,\\nFellini somehow touches something eternal, for there is a lasting sense of\\ninnate goodness about her that simply cannot be forgotten.  For seekers\\nafter wisdom and truth, this is definitely a film that must not be missed. \\nI rate this one 10/10.   \\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nAs a film-lover, there are movies that I\\'ve outgrown, movies that\\ndisappointingly lose their connection to me as I age and mature. Fellini\\'s\\n\"Le Notti di Cabiria\" is one of those movies that seems to grow with me. It\\ngrows richer with each yearly viewing. I never tire of it; I am moved in\\ndifferent ways each time I see it. Fellini and his amazing muse, Giulietta\\nMasina, created one of those rare movie masterpieces in 1957 that comments\\non its time, yet remains fresh and contemporary as well. But I lament that\\nthis gem is so little known today. I trust its recent restoration will help\\nremedy the movie-going public\\'s oversight. The film\\'s rich concluding scene\\nalone (and Masina\\'s glance into our eyes) remains one of the most magical\\nmoments ever projected on a screen.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nGorgeous early Fellini, often considered the mid-point in his career,\\nbetween the more obviously reflective, supposedly realistic early work,\\nand\\nthe bleak extravaganzas that followed.  But Fellini was never a\\nneo-realist\\nin the dull way Rossellini was: his use of landscape was always heavily\\nsymbolic or subjective.  Here Cabiria lives in the middle of a bleak\\nwasteland, which perhaps serves to figure the emptiness of her life, the\\nsterility of life for women in macho Italy, or a comment on post-fascist\\nItaly itself.It doesn't really matter.  The sentiments of the film are actually quite\\ntrite - women are treated badly in Italy, etc.  What's riveting and\\nastonishing is not the experiences of Everywoman, but the experiences of\\none\\nparticular woman.  Although there is a great variety of locales, and\\nCabiria\\nseems to be always moving forward, the film is actually a melodrama.\\nCabiria never escapes, whatever her adventures, wherever she goes, she\\nalways ends up where she started, at home.  Even when she finally sells\\nher\\nhome for a supposed new life, her last (in the film; we just know the\\ncircle\\nwill never be broken) mirrors her first in a depressing\\ncircularity.Yet the film, for all its melancholy, is anything but depressing.  Fellini\\nis most famous for being an indulger of frail male egos, but CABIRIA's\\nstrength lies in its imaginative sympathy with its heroine.  The film's\\nstructure mirrors her situation - the film has no plot as such, just an\\naccumulative series of self-contained episodes which follow the same\\npattern: escape, hope, betrayal.  In each episode, the further Cabiria\\nmoves\\naway form her 'neo-realist' base, the more dream-like (verging on the\\nfantastic) the film becomes, as if she is stepping into an enchanted world\\n(this is made literal when she follows the actor into the nightclub, like\\nsome mythic warrior entering the dragon's lair).  And each time she gives\\ninto the dream world, the illusion is rudely shattered -  the scene at the\\nhypnotist's is as heartbreaking as anything in CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT.  So\\nwhile\\nthe reality/illusion dichotomy is facile as an idea, it is extraordinarily\\npowerful as cinema experienced through character.Fellini's filming is as beautiful as anything in 50s cinema, that decade\\nmirabilis: more restrained and grounded than later, with less obvious\\nflourish, but the mixture of realism and dream is made all the more\\nconvincing with the gentle, coaxing camera movements, beguiling us as well\\nas the heroine, but with the strange editing, and sometimes disruptive\\ncomposition giving us a distance she can never have.Giuletta Masina gives the most sublime performance by an actress in\\nItalian\\ncinema- an exuberant mixture of hope and resignation; her gorgeous big\\neyes\\nnot quite ready to give up yet, even at the end, although the submitting\\nto\\nthe youthful racket seems as hopelessly bleak as 8 1/2.  Her seemingly\\nunprepossessing body is actually an instrument of unparalelled grace, and\\nthe comparisons with Chaplin are not unwarranted - when you see this\\nperformance you'll realise how unexpressive most actors' bodies\\nare.The Chaplin model is not always helpful - there is a mawkishness and\\nemotional manipulation towards the climax that almost grates, but by then\\nyou so adore Cabiria, and so hate everybody else that thought doesn't\\nreally\\ncome into it (although doesn't it seem that many male viewers seem to\\nprefer\\nher as helpless).  Throw in a lovely, playful Nino Rota score and you're\\nin\\nmovie heaven.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nI think there's just two reasons to make make this film the most\\nbeautiful thing I've ever seen on screen. I have yet to see a more\\nbeautiful movie. I'll explain below.The first is the play of emotions. At first Cabiria is upset after\\nfalling in the water. Then she smiles and laughs. Then she's upset.\\nThis transformation of emotions makes you throughout the movie want to\\nsee her smile. And when she laughs you're in heaven. With her. This is\\none reason: transformation of emotions, and your wish for Cabiria to\\nget to laugh.The second thing that moved me with all my emotions was her reaction to\\nsufferance. In her life she suffered before the movie (bad parents,\\nprostitution, social status, poverty), throughout the movie (although\\nher way of living rarely show you her sufferance in the movie, you feel\\nshe's very happy), and probably after the movie ends (again, bad future\\nmost likely). At the final part of the movie the pain is excruciating.\\nShe loses everything that connects her to the life (all her money &\\nhouse), love (lover), social status (marriage) and some hope (in life\\nand Virgin Mary). This is all in one scene. Actually, all she has left\\nare her friends and possibly a suitcase. And then it happens: she's\\nhappy. In the very final part her reaction is: she yells, while crying,\\nto the rubbing lover to kill her. She repeats this. And the final scene\\nis a victory on life. Sure, her life was, is (oh, boy, what must her\\nfeelings be right now) and will be filled with pain. But he takes this\\nreality, a certain fact, nothing's more concrete than this, and twists\\nit: she's happy. In a face of tears, after a horrifying painful\\nexperience, she looks at the unsuspecting people around her that are\\njoyful, happy, friendly, and takes their feeling: she smiles, almost\\nlaughing. There is no reality. The sufferance is beaten. Life has no\\nhard touch on her. This is much more than hope. She is not wishing for\\na better future. She's living it now. Life is transformed with her\\nfinal joy.I have yet to see a better movie. It's the one movie for which: I\\nregistered on IMDb, I voted, I read all the comments, I wrote this\\ncomment. No second place. My current top movies: this movie and below\\nthis everything else. There's not another movie I would recommend to\\nanyone older than 15.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\n`Le Notti di Cabiria', Federico Fellini's 1957 Academy Award winning film,\\nis a poignant, touching and timeless work of Italian cinema.  The film\\ndetails the life of Cabiria (played by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina), a\\n`night bird' who leads a cynical life of prostitution on the streets of\\nRome.  Throughout the film, Fellini guides us through her search for true\\nlove, refuge, and eventual salvation.  Her poetic story is one of sadness,\\nhope, and the unending search for a true place to call home.  Giulietta\\nMasina's brilliant performance draws her audience into her ravaged world and\\nleaves them forever changed.Cabiria has been a prostitute since her youngest days - she recollects\\nentering the streets at 15 with `long, dark hair', unaware of what she was\\ngetting into.  As we learn in the opening scene, she has been consistently\\ntaken advantage of by men, yet attempts to walk a fine line between clinging\\nto them in a search for true happiness and remaining ever independent and\\nself-sufficient.  As soon as the film opens, she is robbed by her pimp, and\\nlater spends the night with a self-consumed wealthy director.  However, the\\ndirector throws her in the closet as soon as his girlfriend arrives and in\\nthe morning quickly escorts a sad Cabiria out of the house, with all her\\nhopes crushed.  During the film Cabiria is frequently enticed by the promise\\nof a new life in her encounters, yet consistently meets impending doom.The most heartbreaking theme of the film is Cabiria's hopeless search for\\nhappiness and salvation.  We see that her friends in the business are no\\nbetter off - Cabiria's story is a universal account.  She is cynical and\\ncold only because of the tragedy she has suffered when she has chosen to\\nshare herself.  However, she makes a gradual transformation throughout the\\nfilm as soon as she meets D'onofrio - a handsome, intelligent and caring man\\nwho finds Cabiria at a comedy show.  Cabiria is at first doubtful and aloof\\naround him, but as the story progresses becomes more open and loving.  She\\nhas finally found the answer in D'onofrio; she proceeds to sell her house\\nand gather her life savings to live the married life as her mother had with\\nD'onofrio.  In the end of the film, her hopes are once again crushed as\\nFellini brings us to a cliff overlooking a river, the same setting as the\\nopening scene in which Cabiria was robbed by her pimp and thrown into the\\nriver.  Cabiria recognizes why D'onofrio has taken her there, breaks down\\ncrying and asks for him to throw her over the cliff.  D'onofrio takes her\\nlife savings and leaves her on the cliff to her sorrows.  Fellini ends the\\nfilm with a shot of Cabiria looking into the camera smiling through her\\ntears - she still has some hope for humanity inside her.It seems that no\\nmatter how desperate her struggles, Cabiria can not leave her life on the\\nstreets.  She tells D'onofrio that as a teenager she and her friend Wanda\\nhad tried to escape the streets through starting a newspaper stand and could\\nnever get it off the ground.  Perhaps it is something about Cabiria that\\nkeeps her working on the streets, perhaps it is her eternal hope in the\\ngoodness of mankind.  She will never stop believing someone good is waiting\\nfor her out in the obscurity of the night.  While at a holy site where Mary\\nwas to have appeared, she begs in tears for Mary to change her life.  Her\\nprayers, expectedly, are not answered.  In `Le Notti di Cabiria', Fellini\\nbreaks our hearts through Giulietta Masina's brilliant portrayal of an\\ninfinite search for love amongst a dark world ravaged with deceit and pain.\\n\\n\",\n",

I have seen\\nLa Strada before and I now rank Fellini's earlier work as among my all\\ntime favorites (along with Ozu.) Masina's tearful smile at the camera\\nat the end is pure magic - so much dignity and hope captured in a\\nsingle second.

       " u'\\nLe Notti is a very rich,thematically, and diversified movie:the\\nfreshness and the concreteness,a strange inebriate detachment (in the\\n\"Alberto\" the movie star episode),men\\'s wickedness,the horrible\\nbaseness,the sordidness,the suavity,the gentleness and the\\nbitterness,the irreverence towards the Christianity,also themes from\\nprevious (Il Bidone,La Strada) and even future (La Dolce vita,Toby\\nDammit,the easy-going eccentric Roman inebriate night life,Rome\\'s night\\nlife) films.Fellini no longer believes in,or no longer practices the\\nShakespearian notes he used in Il Bidone,that kind of Shakespearean\\nintensity.Anyway,like \"Il Bidone\",\"Le Notti\" changes register in its\\nlast part,and offers that unsparing insight deeper than the reality\\nitself.Transitional movie,\"Le Notti\" is at once a recapitulation of\\nthemes from previous works,and a preparation for his future essays (the\\n4 great movies from the \\'60s).The epic texture is still important.I\\ndon\\'t think that Fellini ever bets on the \"social document\",etc.,and\\nhis ephemeral,or,at least,temporary association with some Neorealists\\nin the \\'50s is generally misunderstood and made to mean something it\\nnever was.A thin-skinned prostitute,\"Cabiria\",meets a bashful\\naccountant.Seen through Cabiria\\'s experiences,her tribulations,the\\nthings she sees, tell more about her own mind,she is not,as such,the\\ndirector\\'s representative,though Fellini depicts reproachfully the\\nmalice of some of those met by Cabiria in her way.The world as\\npresented in \"Le Notti ...\" is,at least partially,seen through the\\nprostitute\\'s eyes,hence the touch of grotesque and even some kind of a\\ntwisted naivet\\xe9,a la Sue.In this world seen by Cabiria,there are some\\nlandmarks of concrete humanity,e.g. the philanthropist met by the\\nprostitute,or the Friar.It is always surprising,but also heartening, to\\nsee a man of great intelligence needing to give goodness and humanity a\\nplace in his work.(Kusturica,who refused any resemblance with Fellini\\nand denied any influence,uses the same kind of endowing the sleazy\\nworlds he explores with at least one firm landmark of goodness,so this\\nworld it is not left to its own degeneration and cowardice.)I see in\\nthis lapidary insert that never patronizes the sign of a distinguished\\ndeftness.(In \"Il Bidone\" such a character misses.)Albeit mixed with\\nirony and sarcasm (those of an exceptional mind ),Fellini\\'s compassion\\nis none the less authentic.His relative neutrality,his neatness in\\nhanding this humble epic stuff do not make him an indifferent\\nwitness.(As a youngster,Fellini planned to make a movie about a \"little\\nwildflower of grace\", Serenella ;more interesting is to note that this\\n\"little wildflower of grace\" was,for Fellini,one of \"the two faces of\\nthe Church\".Fellini had opinions,had ideas about real\\nlife,goodness,etc..Fellini even had a very keen and salubrious idea\\nabout the true task of Christianity for man,to \"restore him to his\\ndivine greatness\".)He was also known to admire humility, simplicity,and\\nhe knew to be politically incorrect in this.\"Le Notti\" may be Fellini funniest movie:it abounds in comical\\nthings,and this comic is always tasteful and intelligent.It also has a\\ncertain quality that can be simply described as gentlemanly.Also,let us\\nnote that in \"Le Notti\" Fellini avoided the cruelty\\'s altitude reached\\nalready in \"Il Bidone\",but maintains a more comical and grotesque\\nregister.In \"Le Notti ...\" Fellini still has a narrative thread;he\\ngives shape to various intuitions,feelings, perceptions,dreams,in an\\nimpressionistic and fancy but well-conceived and finely molded way.His\\nenjoyment of the clownish aspects of the reality is a relish.Cabiria\\'s world is explored with Fellini\\'s appetite for the concrete.He\\nconnives with the prostitutes and the hussies,sends Cabiria in the\\nmedium of the rich,in that of the religious pilgrimages....There are\\nsome powerful vignettes,displaying Fellini\\'s gusto and skills for\\nseizing various facets of the social life.His mastership in depicting\\nrealist scenes that none the less have a bizarre and ambiguous twist is\\nobvious in Cabiria\\'s tribulations.With the air of making a purely\\nreflexive and intransitive work,Fellini still expresses freely,with an\\nUn-faked ingenuity, his thoughts about life,people,etc..While affecting\\nto leave outside his feelings and opinions about everyday life and the\\ncommon experience,Fellini none the less slipped his own thoughts and\\nreactions,because he did have them and was not sank into some kind of\\nimpassibility,placidity and indifference.Fellini\\'s ironic\\ndetachment,caustic sometimes,was,in his \\'50s movies,a good way to\\nperceive the reality and to depict it without being patronizing or\\nThesist.The man was very refined and subtle and he refused to be\\nencapsulated,enclosed,encompassed in an artistic formula;he believed in\\nthe richness and irreducible character of both life and art.This\\nplayful man wasn\\'t a joker.Fellini passed a judgment on certain aspects\\nof life,and resented the cruelty and the wickedness,without ever being\\ndidactic or moralist;but it must be said that,as director,he was both\\nvery intelligent and ironic,and ingenuous,natural,spontaneous;one,no\\nless than the other.He was as impassible and as ingenuous as his very\\nkeen intelligence made him to be.Nobody was farther than Fellini from\\nconforming himself to a theoretical model about how should man be and\\ncreate.I want to praise \"Cabiria\"\\'s actors\\' genuineness,beginning with Mrs.\\nMasina;this was her fifth movie with her husband.She was ever more than\\na \"Fellini actress\".Her ethereal and funny approach denotes a very\\nmature understanding.(But it is true that Fellini wanted for his movies\\nreal actors, great actors,not puppets,he favored the creative skills of\\nthe actors.) Fran\\xe7ois P\\xe9rier\\'s performance is simply gold;it has that\\nsensitivity,delicacy,nuances and fineness that are compelling.\"Cabiria\" is on the iridescent side of Fellini\\'s \\'50s career,the other\\nside being the \"realist\" and narrative one.This iridescent side is\\nirreducible to schools and trends,expressing Fellini\\'s refusal to use\\nthe standard methods and to work within a common code,and favoring,at\\nfirst through this poetry of the Faubourg,the experimental and a new\\nApprehensibility.It is important to notice that Fellini was a great\\nexperimenter,and one that never cogs;he is probably the most famed\\ncinema experimenter.( \"I have one great limitation\",said Fellini,\"not\\nhaving general ideas about anything\".)Fellini agreed,once,that \"all my films revolve around \" the \"love\\ntoward one\\'s neighbor\".Those who are used to receive this only in a\\nconventional,didactic way,won\\'t even recognize it in Fellini\\'s works.Averty did the best homage to Fellini,considering him one of the three\\ndirectors that never made a bad movie,and unable to make one.I\\nsubscribe.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI love Federico Fellini, but I dread his early works like La Strada\\nbecause they are so sad. Poor Giulietta Masina, one of the greatest\\nfilm actresses of all time, she always gets the short end of the stick\\nand because the movie magic is so intense, our heart breaks right along\\nwith her.Fellini is the Great Director Italian style. I don't mean he isn't the\\ngreatest director, better than Hitchcock, Welles, a modern like\\nScorcese. I'm looking at his work, have seen most of them, and I can't\\nmake up my mind. He might be the greatest that ever lived. His films in\\nblack and white, the Neo-Realism of Italian film after the war, the\\nincredible original vision, the writing, and directing, it's as though\\nMichelangelo came back as a director.Masina is a prostitute, but her loves turn out to be pocketbook\\ngrabbers. Her physical well being is not high on her boyfriend's\\npriority list. She's such a little women, frail, and in Nights she\\nplays a tough, brawling, whimsical, and hopeless romantic. Her acting\\nstyle is over the top, almost carnival character as she had played it\\nin La Strada, but as Cabiria, she's older, but not necessarily wiser.\\nThe final revelation with French actor Fran\\xe7ois P\\xe9rier is so heart\\nrendering because after an hour and a half of Cabiria's, laughter,\\ntrials, and disappointments, we identify with her completely. And then,\\nin one last scene, the carnival returns with hope.There is so much more to say about this film. You could write a book.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nNights of Cabiria is another neo-realistic Italian cinema that took us\\ndown-right to the world of misfortune,despairing,unloved world of a\\nprostitute.The story of a woman Cabiria who dreamed up of finding true\\nlove in her life.The story follows Cabiria in her quest for love where\\nshe wanders the streets of Rome during night awaiting a wonder to\\nhappen when one day she will find the love of her life,but ironically\\nin her quest she always get betrayed,disrespected and used-up by the\\ndifferent men she encounters in her journey.In this tragicomic tale,Giulietta Masina portrayed the role of innocent\\nand naive women which is one of the greatest performance i have seen\\nfrom any actress in my life.You will gravitate towards her wide,round\\nglittering eyes and her innocent smile.You will grieve for her griefs,\\nfelt sympathy for her and when she smile,the innocence and purity of\\nher smile compel you to smile and rejoice for her, when she pray to\\nMadonna in a shrine i felt like praying with her.Her character was so\\nenergetic,full of passion ans positive attitude towards life,no matter\\nhow much she is in pain and grief she always found a way to laugh.Nights of cabiria is certainly one of the most perfect and equally\\npowerful movie ever made.There is not a single flaw in the direction of\\nFederico Fellini.The movie was more than perfect in every department\\nfrom plot development,cinematography,performance to editing you cannot\\npoint-out a single sign of blemishness in the movie.This movie was\\nentertaining throughout, perfectly paced that allow the audience to get\\ndeeply involve with the story and also prevent from boredom.The scenes\\nwere shot with precise details, perfection and beauty,whether the scene\\nof the prayer in the shrine or the tension and sadness build at the\\nclimax ,every scene was exquisitely brilliant.This movie have one of the most tragic ending i have ever seen.The\\nmovie ended like it started,when she get betrayed again by another man\\nshe fell in love, in-spite of being sad and severely honest to audience\\nabout the harsh reality of world all the time, movie still inspire us\\nat the end same time to never to loose hope. Nights of Cabiria is not a chick flick,this movie has an insight ,the\\ncharacter study of a misfortune women.Just like a mirror,this movie\\nshows us the reality of life,true depiction of the cruel and\\nunaffectionate world we live in but still inspires us.Sometimes,I wonder how can i relate myself so much with a movie that is\\nnot even near around to my culture,language,era and the country.Nights\\nof Cabiria is one of those movies.this movie was made in 1957(the year\\neven when my parents were not born) and from the country of Italy,i\\nhardly know anything about it's culture and language.But still love the\\nmovies from Italy,the country where one of the most beautiful movies of\\nthe world are made.It is because of that these movies have boundless\\nemotions that flows beyond the border of any country,passes all the\\nhurdles of language and time and equally capable to penetrate the\\nemotions of audience,irrespective of it's language and country.The movies like Nights of Cabiria are like Diamond which have no\\ninfluence of time,only they get more and more beautiful as the time\\npasses.The world will never forget the cinematic gems like this.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nBefore viewing \"The Nights of Cabiria\", I had never seen a foreign film\\n(yes, I know, it\\'s a shame... but then again, most fifteen year olds\\nhaven\\'t).  However, \"Sweet Charity\" being one of my favorite musicals when\\nit appeared on Sundance one Saturday night, I couldn\\'t resist.  And I\\'m glad\\nI didn\\'t.  Frederico Fellini is a skillful and masterful man.  His direction\\nis absolutely AWESOME, to say the least.  And words cannot describe the\\nglorious performance of his wife, Giulietta Masina.  Fellini did for Masina\\nwhat Bob Fosse did for his wife, Gwen Verdon on the stage when it was\\ntransposed to \"Sweet Charity.\"  Masina is so believable and so real... with\\nthat street-urchin appearance, those huge, sparkling eyes, that wistful\\nsmile, and her petite figure... she is absolute perfection in the role of\\nCabiria.  This is one film that is a MUST SEE... and if you\\'ve already seen\\nit, SEE IT AGAIN.  Two thumbs up!!!!\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI have seen these film many times and still feel the thrill of contact\\nwith\\nREAL CINEMA. \"Cabiria\" is perfect as it can be. If this were the only film\\nof Fellini it would be enough to prove that he was a genius.Masina is simply unforgettable, and it is such a pity that such films and\\nsuch actors do not exist  anymore.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nIn a way \"Nights of Cabiria\" is the companion piece to \"La Strada\",\\nboth directed by Federico Fellini, both starring his wife and muse\\nGiulietta Masina and both dealing with a woman and her struggle with\\nlife. And yet the movies conclude quite differently. Cabiria is one of\\nthose characters that really get under your skin in the progression of\\nthe film - it\\'s a woman who seems difficult to understand at the\\nbeginning when she\\'s saved from drowning, yet doesn\\'t even have a word\\nof thanks for her saviours and heads off ranting. What follows is grand\\ncharacter development. Episode by episode we get deeper in Cabiria\\'s\\nheart and mind, her hopes and dreams, see her praying for a miracle,\\nbut again and again she fails, is used, ridiculed, ignored. Cabiria is\\nnot just a naive girl stumbling into her doom, she rather seeks\\nsalvation in simplicity and belief when everything else shatters to\\npieces. She\\'s actually quite a complex character - emotional, earthy\\nand proud in her own way, yet vulnerable and always on the brink. And\\nwe are swept away with her when eventually that turn in her fate is\\nactually happening, the change for which we\\'ve all been rooting by\\nthen.It all leads up to one of the most striking final scenes in cinema\\nhistory - Fellini\\'s camera work and Masina\\'s performance invoke pure\\nmovie magic: Never before is a greeting from a total stranger as\\nheart-warming as here, never again will a well-timed nod into the\\ncamera be so electrifying as Cabiria\\'s. Maybe you already know what I\\nmean. In any case I conclude with: Buona sera!\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nNights of Cabiria is one of those timeless old films that will always remain\\npoignant and relevant.  It carries that old innocent cinematic charm of an\\nera that can never be duplicated.Masina, is so talented in this film and this character is SO unforgettable. \\nWHAT TALENT!!  This woman doesn't even have to say anything!!  You just have\\nto look into those huge pupils and watch the variety of expressions on her\\nface that convey so many emotions without a single word.  I would but it in\\ncomparisons to Masina as a circus clown, who can just do everything with her\\nface.The film is a good play on life and redemption in general (done very well\\nmight I add), and for that it rates high for me personally.  It is also very\\nfunny and charming.  I can not comment on how it compares to Sweet Charity\\n(which is based on this film) cause I have not seen it.The film slows in certain sections but is never boring.  GREAT\\nFILM!!Rating 8 out of 10\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n...alongside La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2 and Amarcord. Fellini's films are not\\nfor everybody perhaps, but I admire them how well made made and\\ndirected they are, some of them like Amarcord and the peacock in the\\nsnow have breathtakingly beautiful images that stay long in the mind,\\nfor his choices in composers and actors, for his deliberately paced and\\nsometimes ambitious stories(8 1/2 is especially true of this) and also\\nthat the characters are not always what they seem at first glance.\\nNights of Cabiria I have seen before criticised as grating, sentimental\\nand self-indulgent(the latter being a criticism of Fellini's films in\\ngeneral and him also actually), and while I am understanding, I\\npersonally don't agree.I find Nights of Cabiria to be one of his accessible films, and along\\nwith La Strada also his most moving. Again it is incredibly well made,\\nwith beautiful scenery and cinematography. The images are again very\\nmemorable, and done with much emotional resonance, the best of which\\nbeing the ending which is both tragic and uplifting. Fellini's\\ndirection is superb, the personal nostalgia that is apparent in all his\\nfilms is here and you do identify with the story and the titular\\ncharacter. The music has much beauty and nostalgic charm, while the\\nstory perfectly tells of the sheer happiness and then tearful sorrow of\\nunfortunate Cabiria's life. Cabiria, the titular character, is one you\\ncan identify with immediately, feeling pity and also her conflicting\\nemotions as she tries to remain positive even in the face of adversity.\\nGiulietta Masina gives a bravura performance, her face and eyes are\\nbeautifully expressive and she is just heart-breaking. Francois Perier\\nalso shines as the stranger who makes the offer that is almost too good\\nto be true.Overall, a truly beautiful film and one of Fellini's best, certainly\\none of my favourites as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nLike Maria Falconetti in \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\", Meryl Streep in\\n\"Sophie\\'s Choice\" or Gena Rowlands in \"A Woman Under the Influence\",\\nGuiletta Masina in \"Nights of Cabiria\" displayed, with a poignant\\nauthenticity, the courage to overcome the adversity underlining her\\nvulnerable condition.Coincidentally, like Gena Rowlands with John Cassavettes, Masina was\\ndirected by her husband, Federico Fellini. And I believe this is the\\nkey of intimacy that liberates the actress in front of the camera and\\nallows her to express every single emotion with intensity, and no fear\\nof being over-the-top, the man behind the camera takes care of\\neverything. And \"Intense\" to describe Guiletta Masina\\'s performance is\\nan understatement, so is the very word \"performance\". Masina lives\\nCabiria, with an endearing generosity and universal appeal. Rarely have\\nI felt so much empathy toward a character who happens to be a\\nloud-mouth thirty something prostitute.Cabiria is introduced as a joyful woman living a passionate romance\\nwith Giorgio, she kisses him, embraces him, then he suddenly steals her\\npurse and pushes her into the river, where she nearly drowns before\\nbeing saved by a group of young men. The opening scene is intriguing by\\nits setting, an industrial area far away from the city, and the broad\\ndaylight, and its cheerful tone followed by a tragic twist, then an\\noptimistic resolution. Basically, after a first viewing, you simply\\nrealize how the first minutes, in their tragicomic aspect; represent\\nthe movie in microcosm. But the emotional trap not to fall in is to\\nconsider Cabiria as a pathetic woman on which bad luck keep going on,\\nFellini\\'s film is the chronicles of a series of misfortunes punctuated\\nwith optimistic statements about human nature, and it\\'s up to the\\nviewer, to Cabiria, to see the half-filled or half-empty glass.Cabiria\\'s surprisingly ungrateful reaction after she\\'s rescued is\\nanother indication of her unique temperament. She trusts any bad\\nintentioned smooth-talking Don Juan over any genuinely caring person.\\nIn the following scene, her best friend Wanda seems very concerned and\\nfriendly before being harshly dismissed. Cabiria has the sweetness and\\nthe temper of a child, and her tragedy is that she never displays the\\nright reactions at the right time, making the general mood of the film\\nfascinatingly unpredictable. Cabiria never misses an occasion to dance,\\nwith her unique charisma; she steals the show and creates an eccentric\\ncheerful mood even inside the prostitute\\'s circle. Her positive\\nattitude is a personal way to rise herself above her condition. As she\\nlikes to remind everyone: she owns her house. She has an almost\\nchildish way to brag about the fact that she\\'s not like any prostitute.\\nIndeed, we never see her in activity, she embodies the condition of\\nbeing a prostitute, disdained, insulted, taken advantage of, and her\\neternal suspicious attitude toward any sign of kindness is an\\nunfortunate professional bias. Both tragic and comic, Cabiria reminded\\nme of two classic movies notorious for having inspired Fellini.Cabiria\\'s appearance is almost comical, she\\'s short but doesn\\'t\\nembarrass herself with high heels, instead she has these white socks\\nworn with very unlikely sandals, and eyebrows a la Mickey Mouse. During\\nthe Mambo part, every eyes stare at her. She dances and moves a bit\\nlike Chaplin in \"Modern Times\", Cabiria is a sort of female clown with\\nthe right mix of pathos and burlesque, the Tramp with the umbrella as\\ncane-like accessory. And when she gets in the beautiful house of the\\nrich movie star, and he starts developing a fondness on her, we expect\\na disillusion to come, like the Tramp with the Rich Man in \"City\\nlights\". Mickey Mouse or Charlie Chaplin, Cabiria is the female\\nincarnation of the universally appealing figure of \"little fellow who\\ndoes his best\" in a quite hostile world. The music of Nino Rota\\nembodies the playful mood of Cabiria\\'s misadventures until the sense of\\nurgency in her quest of a new life started to remind of another\\nmasterpiece: De Sica\\'s \"Bicycle Thieves\". Like the new bicycle changed\\nRicci\\'s life, a new love would transform Cabiria, and the desperation\\ngrowing deeper and stronger as indicated in that scene where she joins\\nthe pilgrims and asks the Virgin Mary to change her life, was a\\npowerful reminiscence of Ricci visiting the Wise Woman.This is the dilemma that inhabits \"Nights of Cabiria\", romantic or\\nrealistic. When after having been so mistreated during a magic show\\nCabiria was approached by the kind accountant Oscar, played by Fran\\xe7ois\\nP\\xe9rier, I wanted her to keep her guard up. And as he seemed genuinely\\nin love, convincing her after several meetings, to marry him, and leave\\neverything for him, my heart pounded as I was expecting the worst to\\nhappen. And then came the climactic scene in the cliff when Cabiria\\nunderstood Oscar\\'s dark motives, just like Giorgio\\'s, and she started\\nsobbing, my heart literally melted. Cabiria is the quintessential\\nromantic person, in the denial of the world\\'s reality, and the pain in\\nher heart, was her realization that the vision she always tries to\\nreject was true. But she pulled herself together, started walking when\\na group of happy young people dancing and playing music formed a\\ncheerful parade around her. This was the \"City Lights\"-like ending the\\nmovie needed: the ultimate triumph of the faith in human spirit.\\nCabiria is like reborn in this scene, her eyebrows are natural, her\\nsmile genuine, her wounds healed, as she feels in security again, hence\\nher quick glance at Fellini, behind the camera, or was she simply\\nthanking us, viewers, for loving her?Kabir\\' means \\'big\\' or \\'powerful\\' in Arabic, and I wouldn\\'t be\\nsurprised, if the name was a derivation from that Semitic epithet.\\nCabiria is a character defined by a personality that transcends the\\nlimits of her tiny little body. Size-wise, she\\'s everything but\\nCabiria, street-wise, she has one hell of a big mouth and as a human\\nbeing, her heart is simply gigantic \\x85\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThis is the first Fellini film I ever saw (and thank heavens I saw it on\\nthe\\nbig screen); I absolutely FELL IN LOVE with its now-legendary star\\nGiulietta\\nMasina (in the title role of Cabiria).  Watching the movie, I wanted to\\nshout to her to \"watch out!\" and to jump into the screen to take her away\\nfrom the parasites who wanted to feed on her.  So entranced was I by\\nMasina\\'s performance.  Telling the surface plot is unnecessary here; the\\nfilm\\'s substance happens between the lines: Cabiria\\'s emotional depth\\nbetween the devastations, her perpetual longing for better and, despite it\\nall, her indomitable happiness.  It\\'s the story of predators and prey\\n(Cabiria), and it\\'s a picture of the enduring human spirit. Only an actress\\nof transcendent powers could pull off such a task, and Masina manages it\\nbeautifully.  Look at the IMDb \"Awards & Nominations\" page for this film:\\nin 1957 Masina won \"Best Actress\" at Cannes; in 1958 the film won the Oscar\\nfor \"Best Foreign Language Film;\" and in 1959 the film was nominated for a\\nBritish Academy Award for \"Best Film From Any Source.\"  Three of the film\\'s\\nmagical moments:  1) the \"Hypnotist\" scene.   2) After falling asleep atop\\na\\ncliff where one of those \"predators\" had taken advantage of her, she awakes\\nand the sea below this cliff is now covered by a misty shroud (you\\ninterpret\\nwhat \"being above the clouds\" means).  And 3) after a final personal\\ndevastation, she joins a small troupe of carefree youth in their singing\\nand\\ndancing as they walk the road.  Joining them, her dirt-smudged and\\ntear-swollen face regains its radiance and we feel happy that she\\'s smiling\\nagain.  But the real brilliance of this moment - one of the most affecting\\nin all cinema - is when Cabiria glances briefly INTO THE LENS, smiles and\\nnods AT *US* that she will be alright.  Watching this movie that first time\\nI was happy that she was smiling among these young troubadours, but not\\nuntil she glanced, smiled and nodded directly TO ME did I feel released\\nfrom\\nmy need to rescue and protect her, free to leave the theater and let her go\\non her own (without me).  Personally, no other actress has ever been able\\nto\\npenetrate so completely to my emotional core. Brilliant director, brilliant\\nactress.  SEE THIS MOVIE.  \\n',\n",
       " u'\\nMs. Masina (Mrs. Fellini), is simply one of the most superlative\\nactresses in history. Yes, we all know the infidelities and troubles\\nMr. and Mrs. Fellini had in their life-long marriage. Like every other\\nmarriage we know.What is astonishing are the artistic treasures they left us.\"Nights of Cabiria\" is one among many of the finest films ever made.\"Sweet Charity,\" the musical rip-off of this masterpiece, cheapens the\\nentire enterprise. Good intentions notwithstanding.We don\\'t need Bob Fosse, and certainly not Shirley MacClaine replacing\\nGiulietta Masina, nor second-rate Cy Coleman\\'s score, to \"musicalize\"\\nwhat was already a brilliant musical (thanks to Nino Rota and\\nBonagura).Fellini\\'s film \"sings\" on its own, thank you.\"Sweet Charity\" is a perfect example of Hollywood and Broadway making a\\ntravesty of art.\"Sweet Charity\" -- film and stage performances -- are hollow, shallow\\nexercises compared to the original film. Yeah, Shirley and Chita Rivera\\nand Paula Kelly dance up a storm. Nothing to do with the story or the\\ncharacters. Everything to do with making a \"musical.\" What fun!\\nUnfortunately, Broadway and Hollywood cut out the heart. Dancing\\nzombies.Fellini\\'s film is the gem. Polished to within an inch of its life,\\nthough pretending to be a diamond in the rough. Like all Fellini\\'s\\nworks.Giulietta Masina IS the tiny hooker you want to love. No Hollywood\\n\"star\" \"playing\" a hooker: she simply is. Like all (few) great\\nactresses.Fellini knows what he has, in a wife, in an actress. He\\'s genius enough\\nto turn the camera on her and let her genius shine.Don\\'t think she\\'s a genius? Try \"La Strada.\" \"Juliet of the Spirits.\"\\n\"Ginger and Fred.\" Or her non-Fellini-directed turn in \"Madwoman of\\nChaillot\" with Katherine Hepburn.Giulietta Masina is as gifted a cinema actress as there ever was.Federico Fellini is as gifted a cinema director as there ever was.Marriages between geniuses are rare.Fellini is without peer.Give the actress, and her director husband, their due.Cinema has never seen their likes before or since.Fellini and Masina.

       " u\"\\nI saw this movie for the first time last night, and I have to post my\\nfirst review on the site to say it is really wonderful. Giulietta\\nMasina's performance is truly one of the most impressive I've ever seen\\n- her face is as expressive as Buster Keaton's or Charlie Chaplin's.The movie is a deceptively simple story about the day-to-day encounters\\nof a prostitute who does the best she can to make a living and maintain\\nher hopes and dreams of a better life. Her relationships with her\\nneighbors, friends, and street-corner associates are a major focus, as\\nare her relationships with the many men that come and go in her life.\\nIn the latter regard, it is obvious that this film was the inspiration\\nfor many other plays and films, including Sweet Charity. The series of people encountered by Cabiria in the movie shows us the\\nfull range of human reaction to life's adversity - some respond with\\ncynicism and prey on others without remorse, some respond with\\ngenerosity and hope, some respond by clinging to certain belief systems\\nthat don't really help them in a material way, etc. Cabiria definitely\\nstands out as a unique character within the gritty, grimy community of\\npost-war Rome, where there are stark differences between people of\\ndifferent classes and livelihoods. We can see that she is a good person\\nliving in a world that is not always humane or fair.I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it took a lot of\\ncreativity and inspiration to include the ending of this movie as it is\\n- I'm sure it was as startling and unexpected to audiences in 1957 as\\nit is emotionally moving still today.The direction, photography, and acting are all first-rate in this\\nclassic. Everybody involved was obviously engaged in a labor of love. I\\ncannot recommend it more highly.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis is being a very typical Fellini movie, with a Fellini style and\\nlook to it as well as some of the typical characters and story\\ndevelopments. And I must say that this is probably one of my favorite\\nFellini movies! As basically all Fellini movies, it has a very simple concept and an\\nextremely straightforward storyline. It\\'s simply following its main\\ncharacter around, who is in search of love and happiness. The story is\\ngetting told almost like an adventure movie, as the main character\\nvisits lots of different places and is meeting a wide variety of\\ncharacters. The movie is foremost a drama but it also has a strange\\ncomedy tone to it, making this still a very entertaining movie to watch\\nas well.The message you can take from it is that you shouldn\\'t desperately\\nsearch for happiness and then expect to end up getting more happy than\\nyou were before. That\\'s a lesson the main character in this movie\\nlearns the hard way. But luckily it really isn\\'t a movie that is being\\npreachy in any way. It never tries too hard to get its message across\\nor to try to get any emotions out of you. It\\'s a far too subtle and\\nsuperiorly made movie for that.Most credit of course needs to go to Federico Fellini, who does a\\nwonderful job with the storytelling. But the cinematography also is an\\nimportant aspect. The movie has some very dynamic camera-work in it,\\nthat makes the movie a very lively and warm one, even thought its shot\\nin \\'cold\\' black & white.But just as much credit needs to got to Mrs. Fellini, or rather said\\nGiulietta Masina, who plays the lead role. She goes through some\\namazing transitions throughout this movie and she was an actress that\\ncould act just as well with just only her eyes and facial expressions.\\nTruly a wonderful performance and all a real pleasure to watch. It\\'s\\nprobably even a better performance than the one in the other Fellini\\nmovie \"La strada\", which was also a movie that I just loved.Simply storytelling and film-making at its very best!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\\n',\n",

I would\\ndescribe it differently, although the comparison with wine will still\\nbe relevant. The thing that makes this film great, in my opinion, is\\nits 'aftertaste' . While I was watching the film, I was stunned by the\\nacting of Masina, yet not in another way then with 'La Strada'. When\\nthe film ended I was very impressed, yet not as much as when I saw\\n'Otto e Mezzo'. The thing is, I'm finally realising how much I loved\\nthis film, while I'm writing this. Maybe the acting wasn't superior to\\n'La Strada's' acting. I actually liked the rest of the cast better in\\n'La Strada' (which included Quinn and Basehart besides Masina). Nor was\\nthe film as challenging and sophisticated as 'Otto e Mezzo'. But 'La\\nStrada' didn't have a story like 'Le Notti di Cabiria' and a divine\\ncharacter like Cabiria. And 'Otto e Mezzo' didn't have Masina in it.\\nThat's what makes 'Le Notti di Cabiria' as memorable as it is. And\\nbecause of that, this film can be called Fellini's true masterpiece\\nand, by saying that, one of the best films ever made.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nI've only recently become a foreign cinema fan in the last 5 years. Was\\nexposed to Italian horror films many years before that but in recent\\nyears have watched more of the classics, non-genre type stuff. Saw La\\nDulce Vita last April and loved it. last week, this was watched. Boy,\\nthis is good. Very oddly constructed scenes at time and the B&W really\\nsets the tone for this odd tale of prostition. Lots of symbolism about\\nreligion and class in 1940's Italy.Fellini is a true master. The lead actress seems like a real person, not an actress, and so many\\nof the extras as well(they probably were not actors),...it really gives\\nyou this odd feel. Never too many cuts of C-U shots either, which i\\nlike.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThe world of Federico Fellini was ,is and will be holding us captives\\nas long as Cinema as Art exists. \"The Nights Of Cabiria\" is no\\nexception.Though chronologically it belongs to the 50ies of the 20th\\ncentury ,it is a strong message to us all, to our children, to those\\nwho will come after:hope against hope;never give up;the darkest moments\\nin life will pass, blind and irrational (as it seems)belief in human\\ngoodness always prevails, whereas blind religious fervor always fails (\\nwe should not forget that Fellini had always been critical of the\\nCatholic Church). Julietta Masina is a superb actress who had actually\\nsacrificed her might-have-been outstanding career(in fact, what she had\\naccomplished is remarkable,but she could have done much much more as an\\nactress) for the sake of her husband, and that makes her even greater\\nas a human being.Of course, her \"smile through tears\" is unforgettable.\\nNino Rota\\'s music does not just add to ,but co-creates the atmosphere\\nof the film , the rarest case, when two genii(Rota and Fellini)found\\neach other as wonderful partners-in-art, never trying to overshadow\\neach other. I teach a course in European Cinema at a university in\\nTaiwan, and I always show my Chinese students \"The Nights of\\nCabiria\".Their reaction and feedback are amazing:they FEEL the\\ncharacters of different time and culture with an amazing intensity.It\\njust proves once again that true ART has no boundaries.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nNights of Cabiria saw Giulietta Masina get the award for best actress\\nin the European version of our academy awards.Like Bette Davis in 1937\\nand 1938 who was nominated for in Human Bondage and lost an award\\neveryone thought was hers only to win on her next nomination for\\nDangerous.Masina should have won for La Strada in 54 but won on her\\nnext nominated performance in 1957 for Nights Of Cabiria the awards\\npeople obviously not wanting to be seen as having missed the boat twice\\nin three years.That being said Giulietta put in a performance worthy of\\naward status.Cabiria a streetwalker has her own home, a small bank\\naccount,and is fiercely independent.She has the same hopes and dreams\\nof everyday middle-class people.She and her friend Wanda seem to want a\\nnormal life but have somewhat resigned themselves to making the best\\nout of the life!She takes pride that her and Wanda whenever possible\\ntry and get picked up at the higher class locales,that she has only\\nslept under a bridge once or maybe twice,and the fact that she\\nstaunchly refuses to accept a pimps protection.she would like to have\\nreal love in her life but is practical about her expectations,partly\\ndue to negative experiences of such.The cinematography makes you feel\\nlike you are in Italy as Fellini takes his camera to the streets of\\nRome and her provinces.There is no pre-fab Hollywood sets here.Cabiria\\nlike Gelsomina will remain in your mind and heart long after this film\\nhas been watched.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThis is my favorite film of all time.\"Cabiria\" is why Fellini is hailed as one of the world\\'s great\\nartists.Back then he had that rare gift for crafting--heck, channeling--no nonsense\\nstories whose import is at the once unflinchingly mythical and trenchantly\\npractical in its examination of what it is to be a part-ape/part-angel\\nhuman.  All that, and he could do the million-and-one other things necessary\\nto create what is, after all, a treasured objet d\\'art that speaks to the\\nmasses about what is universal and important; true love.  And it does all\\nthis absent a cop-out \"feel good\" ending!I\\'m so thankful for the recent restoration and DVD, including the\\nreinsertion of the \"man with the sack\" scene.  I was particularly thankful\\nfor De Laurentiis\\'s angle on the story of the original excising of that\\nsegment.  It only serves to impress upon us that Fellini was in no wise\\nkidding when he characterized himself as a professional prevaricator.  Amen\\nto that!  And see this movie!  The greatest bittersweet lie ever told, with\\nthe power to change the way you see yourself and others.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nBefore viewing \"The Nights of Cabiria\", I had never seen a foreign film\\n(yes, I know, it\\'s a shame... but then again, most fifteen year olds\\nhaven\\'t).  However, \"Sweet Charity\" being one of my favorite musicals when\\nit appeared on Sundance one Saturday night, I couldn\\'t resist.  And I\\'m glad\\nI didn\\'t.  Frederico Fellini is a skillful and masterful man.  His direction\\nis absolutely AWESOME, to say the least.  And words cannot describe the\\nglorious performance of his wife, Giulietta Masina.  Fellini did for Masina\\nwhat Bob Fosse did for his wife, Gwen Verdon on the stage when it was\\ntransposed to \"Sweet Charity.\"  Masina is so believable and so real... with\\nthat street-urchin appearance, those huge, sparkling eyes, that wistful\\nsmile, and her petite figure... she is absolute perfection in the role of\\nCabiria.  This is one film that is a MUST SEE... and if you\\'ve already seen\\nit, SEE IT AGAIN.  Two thumbs up!!!!\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n...and, for me, one of the great acting jobs in the history of\\nfilm. I know,\\nI know, that sounds like hyperbole, but Masina's face is a miracle here,\\nable to project any emotion with a twitch of the lips, a waggle of the\\neyebrows. Oh, why am I writing about it? You need to see this movie, and\\nif\\nyou've already seen it, you need to see it again.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nCabiria is a wretched prostitute who in spite of her vulgar bravado is\\nsensitive and fragile like a child.

They can just show\\ninterest in her to make her give them everything she has.Giulietta Masina found a great gesture for Cabiria - a wry smile, the smile\\nof shyness and despair, loneliness and uneasiness, and at the same time of\\ngreat dare and resoluteness. And it is this smile that makes us love and\\nsympathize with Cabiria - a delicate and awkward child who has to overcome\\nherself to earn her hard living. But she is the one who has guts: robbed\\nand\\nbetrayed, deceived and disillusioned, she is never beaten; she goes on\\nliving, no matter how hard it might be.Although filmed in 1957, \"Nights of Cabiria\" is still exciting and\\nrevealing, since it touches the inmost human feelings and depicts true\\nhuman\\ncharacters.\\n\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nIt would be far too simplistic to feel that the film merely presents an\\noptimist\\'s commitment to live and enjoy life in an imperfect world.\\n\"Nights of Cabiria\" has always intrigued me among the many Fellini\\nfilms that I have seen\\x97-it is great cinema that asks more questions\\nthan it provides answers.Question one\\x97who is the altruist who provides alms in the night to the\\nwretched of the earth? The only reason for the addition of this\\ncharacter seems to be that Fellini wants a contrasting figure who works\\nin the night\\x97one who gives sustenance to others in a commendable way\\x97a\\nway Cabiria would have preferred to live her life if she had an option.\\nIt was amusing for me to find out that this entire sequence was deleted\\nin earlier released versions of the film. My guess is that this\\nsequence was an addition of screenplay writer Pasolini, as it would fit\\ninto his style of Christian Marxism, more than the neorealism of\\nFellini. Interestingly, this is one of the three males in the film\\n(others being the actor who invites Cabiria home, and Brother Giovanni)\\nwho seem to have a pure heart and good intentions\\x97all the others seem\\nto have a predominant evil streak.Question two\\x97-Brother Giovanni leaves a profound effect on Cabiria.\\nConfessing to him (she thinks he is a full fledged priest) and having\\nMass celebrated by him was Cabiria\\'s wish but the cold response she\\nreceives from Giovanni\\'s colleague, who is apparently a full-fledged\\npriest, seems to be Fellini\\'s/Pasolini\\'s comment on the\\nChurch\\x97otherwise why have the scene? Question three-\\x97Cabiria\\'s eyebrows change their shape as she\\ncontemplates a married life. This is not in line with Fellini\\'s\\nCabiria, who would think about the effect eyebrows will make as she\\nswitches gears in her personal life. Or is Fellini suggesting that as\\nCabiria steps on the threshold of marriage, the personality of Cabiria\\nchanges to a more calculating woman, in contract to the earlier simple,\\nwaif like personality.Apart from questions such as these, it is unquestionably one of\\nFellini\\'s finest films. I preferred \"La Strada,\" another Fellini film\\nwith his wife Guilietta Massina in the lead role, and his later less\\ntalked about \"Orchestra Rehearsal,\" made some 20 years later, in which\\nsocial commentary takes center stage and storyline the backstage.I am surprised that most Fellini viewers are taken up with performances\\nand the story each Fellini film offers. The more poignant world of\\nFellini revolves around the commentary on the divide between the rich\\nand the poor, the honest and the dishonest, the religious and the\\nagnostic. The allure of Fellini to me remains his social commentary\\x97-he\\nunderlines this with Cabiria, in the final shot looking at you the\\nviewer, bringing up the nexus between the character and the viewer. In\\nfact, this final shot ought to wake up the sensibilities of the\\nlaid-back cinema viewer.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nFederico Fellini's Masterpiece Le notti di Cabiria is about a young\\nwoman's odyssey,who is by the way a prostitute,throughout Rome.During\\nthis odd adventures she comes face to face with her dreams but she\\nnever accomplishes them.She in a nostalgic climate looks back when she\\nwas younger and more innocent.She is a human being who admires people\\nwho give love and are selflessness.In the end she gets charmed from one\\npeople like those and in her kindness she believe's him but him tragic\\nconclusions.The trust that she shows to people throughout the film is\\nthe reason she gets deluded,but those characteristics make her,even she\\ndoesn't realize it one of those people she admires.The ending although\\nit seems sad in total,the last taste that the audience takes is the\\nview of a fighter,a human that looks everyone in the eyes and doesn't\\nfear to show feelings to anyone.The movie might seem boring to some people but when they'll reach to\\nthe ending they will be remunerated.The ending climax and the landscape of one of the most dramatic scenes\\nin cinema is outstanding.The viewer draws away from the happy turn the\\nmovie has gotten and is thrown for another time to cruelty of the\\nworld,but for another time people have to turn their backs to\\nheartbreak and death and fight again.The viewer suffers with the\\ncharacter in a silent scene where both the actress and the director\\nprove their talents.Summing up the movie is totally worth watching.Having a clear mind\\nwhile watching it will help to get all the meanings many of which have\\nescaped this review.Highlight of the film:The Ending.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nFrom director Federico Fellini (Amarcord), this is another film, in the\\nItalian language, that I found inside the pages of the book 1001 Movies\\nYou Must See Before You Die, it is one I liked the sound of as well.\\nBasically Maria 'Cabiria' Ceccarelli (BAFTA nominated Giulietta Masina)\\nis the wide-eyed street walking prostitute with not many friends but a\\nseemingly good outlook on life, and despite living on the poor end of\\nRome she does have a small house, a bank account and her dreams to keep\\nher going. The story follows Cabiria through a few nights (and days)\\nspending time with various men who have the same thing in common, they\\nall treat her rotten and disappear very quickly. These mistreating men\\ninclude a man who steals 40,000 lire and almost drowns her with her\\ninability to swim, a movie star who pays little attention to her, and a\\nman of god giving to the poor but again not drawing to her in any way.\\nAll Cabiria can do is spend a little time with her friend Wanda (Franca\\nMarzi), and religious services to pray to the holy one in order to have\\nher dream of a better life come true, including finding a man who truly\\nloves her. After helping an illusionist/hypnotist act on stage she\\nmeets accountant Oscar D'Onofrio (Fran\\xe7ois P\\xe9rier) who seems genuinely\\nkind and as they get to know each other liking the idea of a future\\ntogether, at first she is cautious and suspicious, but she does fall in\\nlove with him. They marry within only a few weeks, and during their\\nhoneymoon they spend time walking through the woods and towards a cliff\\noverlooking the lake, and Oscar becomes very suspicious indeed. Cabiria\\nrealises he intends to push her off the cliff and steal her money, so\\nshe just gives up her purse and lets him get away, but walking down the\\nlong road back home she can only smile through her tears in a parade of\\npeople, she must be hopeful that things will be alright. Also starring\\nAmedeo Nazzari as Alberto Lazzari, Aldo Silvani as The Wizard, Dorian\\nGray as Jessy, Ennio Girolami as Amleto, Mario Passante as Uncle of\\nAmleto and Pina Gualandri as Matilda the prostitute. In the leading\\nrole Masina, also Fellini's wife at the time, is wonderful with her\\nquirky facial expressions, venerability and child like attitude, she is\\npretty much the key to why this film is so watchable, the character\\nhaving all these misusing men are the most interesting scenes, it is a\\nthought provoking and enjoyable masterpiece, a great drama. It won the\\nOscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated the BAFTA\\nfor Best Film from any Source. Very good!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is my first comment on a movie so be nice, thanks. It is hard to\\ndescribe exactly what I felt during this movie but I was really moved.\\nDirected beautifully by Fellini casting his beautiful wife as the star.\\nShe has the most amazing smile and wonderful facial expressions. I\\nloved Oscar, he seemed to be just like me, except for the ending. He\\nacted out his love with passion and even deceived me, a little\\ntearjerker. My favorite part was when Cabiria encountered the\\nmagician/hypnotist. He gave such thought to his words and had such\\npoise and was a great entertainer, reminding me kind of like Edward\\nNorton in the illusionist. Oscar then took me away with his beautiful\\nwords. The first couple lines are his best. I love how at the end she\\nis torn and sad walking down the street with all the kids playing music\\nand dancing ironically next to her. She uses that to cheer herself up\\nwhich brings that great loving smile of hers to show us that she is\\nstill living and the worst is hopefully over, this gives us hope! I\\nlove how everyone keeps calling her a nut yet she still tries showing\\neverybody that she isn't what they think, even though it's not what\\nother people think of you that matters but what you think of yourself.\\nShowing other people just helps bring it out and who wouldn't want to\\nshow other people how you have changed for the better. Everyone is in\\nsearch for happiness but happiness lies within. Many people don't know\\nthat but it's how you think of things that brings happiness. A mind is\\na great thing. I would definitely watch this movies more times to come\\nand hope to get it on DVD. This is an art masterpiece. I've heard much\\nabout Fellini, and this was my first movie of him I've seen. He greatly\\ninfluenced David Lynch, my favorite director and one of the best artsy\\nmovie directors, as well as Stanley Kubrick. I look forward to seeing 8\\n1/2 which could be more comparable with Lynchian works. PS The only\\nreason that I give it an 8 and not 10 is because I want to leave room\\nfor improvement which there always is.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis is the very first time I see an Italian movie, and I loved it!\\nThis was very adorable movie. It was a nice journey, that I am glad I\\ntook. The movie was produced in 1957, set in the beautiful city of Rome\\nand directed and co-written by Frederico Fellini.The story of the movie is about a pretty crazy prostitute who we join\\nin her journey of life, she looks for love and salvation. It\\'s funny\\nand true. She is an optimist who sings, dances and swears a lot.The idea is really nice, I don\\'t know how often was a prostitute\\'s\\nstory shown in a movie in the 1950\\'s, but it\\'s defiantly an interesting\\nidea. Let\\'s see what I loved, I loved how open minded and independent\\nwas Cabiria (main character) in the movie, she owned her own house and\\nwas so proud of it. She wasn\\'t looking for marriage as much as love.She\\nwanted to change her life and didn\\'t accept just how things were.I also\\nenjoyed how although she went to church and asked for grace from virgin\\nMary, nothing changed in her life, because she kept it as it.I thought the directing was very good, it kept me interested and\\nenjoying the movie. I loved the scenery and acting of all actors. It\\nwas fun, lots of fun, even the soundtrack is fun, please listen to itMy favorite scene involved Cabiria hypnotized and revealing here true\\ninnocence in front of many people on stage.I still had few comments that I didn\\'t like, when she met a father in\\nthe church, he told her you must get married, it\\'s women\\'s duty to have\\nchildren and be wives, that was a little lame. And it made me feel as\\nif its sending a message that those who want to be independent, must be\\nbad and that they should go back to their \"natural\" duties. Also it\\nkinda made me sad that although she such an optimist, things never\\nturned out right for her. I absolutely loved the ending scene, brought\\na smile back to my face.At the end, I would recommend the movie and would say it\\'s very\\nenjoyable.

       " u'\\nMost of us watch a lot of movies in our lives. I saw \"Nights of\\nCabiria\" twelve years ago in a friend\\'s college dorm room. We were all\\nsitting around, and my film student friend popped in \"Nights of\\nCabiria.\" I had no idea what to expect. I had never even heard of the\\nmovie. Talk about the proverbial sucker punch! Cabiria has stayed in my\\nmind ever since, and I find myself thinking about her all the time.\\nThat\\'s the power of this film. There\\'s no need to comment on the acting\\nand directing, which are simply astonishing. What makes this movie so\\nexceptional is the fact that the audience cannot help but fall madly,\\ntragically in love with Cabiria (and of course with Masina). Throughout\\nthe movie, as others have noted, I just wanted to jump into the screen\\nand hug her, save her from those around her and her own naivety. At the\\nend of the day, it is our affection for Cabiria that pushes this movie\\nto the heights of raw, emotional power.And that phenomenon is displayed so beautifully in the famous, magical\\nclosing ten minute sequence. I have to admit, when Oscar stole her\\nmoney on the cliff, and we saw her (yet again) go from the euphoria of\\nbeing in love to rolling on the ground, begging him to kill her, I was\\nfurious. How could Oscar do that to our beloved Cabiria? And more\\nimportantly, how DARE Fellini do this to me!!!! And that was the magic\\nof Fellini. He KNEW that, by this point, the audience was so totally\\ninvested in Cabiria that her heartbreak was our heartbreak. Widely\\nhailed as one of, if not THE most emotionally powerful endings in film\\nhistory, Cabiria\\'s final walk through the forest is simply beyond\\nwords. The explosive power, again, lies in the fact that we care SO\\nmuch for this character, and when she smiles through her tears while\\nwalking among the festival goers, she looks in the camera (and in our\\neyes) and nods, letting us know that she will be okay. It\\'s the most\\ngenerous moment I have ever witnessed in film. I have chills just\\nthinking about it.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nReview:I think you can make the argument that Fellini\\'s \"Juliet of the\\nSpirits\" (1965) is the female counterpoint to his \"8 \\xbd\" (1963). Both\\nare films that analyze a central character whose life seems to be\\ncoming apart at the seams, in large part due to extra-marital affairs\\nand existential concerns. In \"8 \\xbd\" we have the Guido, who wants to tame\\nall the women in his life to restore a semblance of continuity in his\\ncareer and in his existence. With \"Juliet of the Spirits,\" we follow\\nJuliet, a woman who has been shattered by her cheating husband and who\\ndecides to leave him to restore that same sort of continuity of\\nexistence Guido sought.But before \"8 \\xbd\" and \"Juliet of the Spirits\" Fellini made two other\\nfilms that serve as gender based counterpoints \\x96 \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960)\\nand \"Nights of Cabiria.\" (1959). Both films explore similar characters\\nand similar themes. Fellini\\'s heroes in these films are the bottom rung\\nof society and we watch as they try to scrape their way out of their\\npositions in search of greater meaning and purpose. While \"La Dolce\\nVita\" is the superior film, \"Nights of Cabiria\" still holds its own.In recent years \"Nights\" has joined Fellini\\'s \"La Strada\" in accruing a\\nwider and wider audience. Slowly, these films are becoming as widely\\nseen as \"8 \\xbd\" and \"La Dolce Vita.\" \"Nights of Cabiria\" tells the story\\nof Cabiria, a tiny and cute prostitute whose innocence is her greatest\\ncharm and weakness. Fellini buffs will note that we have met Cabiria\\nonce before in Fellini\\'s first feature \"The White Sheik\" (1952). Both\\ntimes she is played by Fellini\\'s wife, the great Giulietta Masina.Masina always has such an expressive face. In some scenes she can\\nexhibit the angelic demeanor of a child and in others she can look as\\nmorose as an old, dying woman. \"Nights of Cabiria\" begins with\\nCabiria\\'s pimp stealing her purse and pushing her into a river. She\\nnearly drowns. When she is saved she is discouraged to understand her\\npimp valued her life less than the 40,000 lira he stole with her purse.\\nCabiria leads a sad existence but she is indomitable. She does not give\\nup, no matter how dire the circumstances.Like with Marcello in \"La Dolce Vita,\" we follow Cabiria through a\\nseries of episodic adventures that mostly take place at night. One\\nnight she gets picked up by a famous movie star who\\'s had a falling out\\nwith his finacee. Another time, Cabiria follows a rhapsodic crowd that\\nlongs to have a vision of the Virgin Mary. Another night she meets a\\nGood Samaritan handing out food to the homeless. With this Samaritan,\\nCabiria meets an older prostitute who used to be a beauty, now living\\ndestitute in a cave outside of Rome. For Cabiria, this woman is a\\nforecast of things to come if she doesn\\'t change her life.Thus, when a nice man comes out of the night, expressing love and his\\nintentions to marry Cabiria, she sees her way out. Are these man\\'s\\nintentions true and honest? I will not give it away - but I will say\\nthat Fellini has a tendency to bookend his films.The final scene of \"Nights of Cabiria\" is beautiful and one of\\nFellini\\'s best endings. It is a synthesis of a parade and a party with\\nCabiria at the center, staring with quiet determination into the\\ncamera. Of all Fellini\\'s vivid images, this one may best encompass his\\nvision of the human experience.Rating:On a scale of one to \"Casablanca\", this film is an \"About Schmidt\"\\n(2003).Rationalization:I think you\\'d be hard pressed to find a person who wouldn\\'t admit that\\nsometimes life can be a series of low-blows and inequities. And yet, we\\nstruggle on, trying to make the best of our situations in an otherwise\\ncruel and indifferent world. Movies like these make me grieve and hope\\nfor humanity, showing us what is best in our natures while never\\ndenying we are pathetic creatures with a loose grip on even our own\\nlives.http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nNever before have I seen a film so sad and happy at the same time. The\\nfilm stands at the midpoint of these two diverse feelings, and somehow\\nthe ending is able to reconcile the two into a coherent and\\nunderstandable scenario for our favorite Italian prostitute, Cabiria.This is a story that really hinges on the performance of the lead, and\\nit could have gone either way despite Federico Fellini being behind the\\ncamera. Fortunately, his wife was in front of it, and Giuiletta\\nMasina's performance does far more than carry the weight of the plot.\\nShe transcends practically every scene, basing her performance on\\nCharlie Chaplin and dancing as much as she can. Of course we love her,\\nbut more than that we sympathize for her; despite her job we see her as\\nsomeone we might know, sweet and gentle but very naive.Also to be commended is the style in which Fellini documents this\\njourney; we are taken through the seedy undergrounds of Rome some 50\\nyears ago. Cabiria's life has its most unpleasant moments, such as the\\nopening sequence and when she goes home with a famous Italian movie\\nstar, but Fellini always feels for her and so do we. By the time the\\nending arrives, we are utterly ensnared in the short, rather unusual\\nlooking woman. And it is because of the husband and wife team of\\nactress and director that we care about any of these people and are so\\nmoved by what is easily one of the best final scenes in movie history.\\n\",\n",

As her life unfolds as a\\nprostitute, she never loses her Cinderella dream while those around her\\ncrush it in every which way possible. But she does meet her \"prince\",\\nand she is led to believe her story will end \"happily ever after\", and\\nthat\\'s when we the audience is let in for a shock of horrific\\nproportions. But, as we sit and watch this unfold, Fellini delivers\\nskillfully what only Fellini can; and in that, we sigh with relief as\\nwe are still on Cabiria\\'s side of love and hope.Filmmed in Black and White (subtitled) with all the artistry and\\nrawness of Fellini, this is the type of picture that makes you fall in\\nlove with film and story. No special effects, no contrived love story.\\nThis is done as if these are folks you know and see everyday. You can\\'t\\nreally turn away, you want to know what\\'s next. Excellent film.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI\\'ve never seen a Federico Fellini movie that I didn\\'t like, and \"Le\\nnotti di Cabiria\" is certainly another great one, telling the story of\\nnaive but self-standing prostitute Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) wondering\\nthrough Rome looking for love but never finding it. Whether she gets\\npushed into the river (and then gets angry when the boys saving her\\ndon\\'t know where the man went), or acts out a childhood scene for a\\nhypnotist, or gets involved with a movie star, Cabiria never loses\\nfaith in her aim.I thought that the two most effective scenes in the movie were the\\nchurch and the movie star\\'s house. In the church, there\\'s an invalid\\nhoping to get cured, but it doesn\\'t happen, much like how Cabiria never\\nattains her goal; not even in the seemingly holiest of places can\\npeople come across what they seek. In the movie star\\'s house, she has\\nto walk up a staircase to get to his room. The camera angle faces up,\\nmaking it look as though she is walking up to heaven and can finally\\nget what she wants. But she doesn\\'t, and then walks back down the\\nstairs. They film it from above, so that it looks as though she has to\\nleave this fantasy world that she had entered and come back down to\\nreality. (Note: this is all conjecture, so don\\'t quote me.) All in all,\\nFellini accomplished another masterpiece here. Part of what\\'s so great\\nabout the movie is how he introduces the characters. Not just Cabiria,\\nbut also her prostitute friends, and how men pick them up. It\\'s a movie\\nthat I recommend to everyone. Even if you\\'re the type who only likes\\nHollywood movies saturated with mindless action, you at least gotta\\ngive this movie a try.\\n',\n",

But very, very few films have ever\\nevoked such beauty and warmth than Fellini\\'s \"Nights of Cabiria\". There\\nis a certain poetry and honesty that haunts every frame in this film,\\nand while the writing is beautiful, after the film is over you don\\'t\\nremember the dialogue, or even the story. You remember the moments, the\\nfaces, the images, the places where this film takes place.I have never cried during or after a movie, and I don\\'t think I ever\\nwill. But \"Nights of Cabiria\" moved me as close to tears as I think any\\nfilm will ever have the power to do.\\n',\n",

We all smiled at\\neach other, and left without speaking. Masina is called a female Chaplin by some- Frankly, she is better.I\\nhave also read criticisms of her for this. Why?

Her facial expressions confirm that communication is\\nonly 40% verbalThe \"man with the sack\" scene was not censored by the church- If\\nanything this film is very pro- catholicism; temptation vs salvation.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nDisagreeing with many of Federico Fellini\\'s opinions, I don\\'t deny that\\nhe has not belonged to the list of my favorite directors. Some of his\\nmovies are really difficult and a bit psychedelic. However, I have to\\nadmit one thing clearly: Fellini was one of the few men in cinema who\\nwas able to create something really powerful, captivating, enthralling,\\ncontroversial, something really innovative: and that is what one may\\nundeniably say about NIGHTS OF CABIRIA, his 1957 movie where again,\\nafter marvelous LA STRADA, he cast his wife Giulietta Masina in the\\nlead, a performance that may be regarded as one beyond any awards. But\\nlet me analyze the content of the movie first before I comment on\\nacting.Cabiria, an outsider among outsiders who is \"living the life\" is a\\nRoman prostitute whom we find rather individual and with whom, from the\\nvery beginning, we can easily empathize. She is robbed, thrown to the\\nTiber River and, fortunately, rescued by a group of men. From this \"in\\nmedia res\" opening moment, we start to get to know her. In spite of\\nCabiria\\'s profession, she is not that \"immoral.\" What Cabiria gets\\nthrough is disappointment. She cannot understand that someone who\\nalways said \"I love you\" stole a few thousand Lira and was going to\\nkill her. Although she seems to have a friend at her side, Wanda\\n(Franca Marzi), also a prostitute, she feels lonely and desperate. The\\ndirector masterfully supplies us with Cabiria\\'s physical and\\npsychological journey through different places, realities...something\\nvery life-like. Therefore, the movie appears to be built upon various\\nworlds=various moments that do not have much in common with one another\\nbut which constitute a perfect integration at a higher level of life\\nanalysis. This is rather a series of events than a linear plot and...\\nthese events are really unforgettable being embedded in highly\\nunpredictable action.Perfect harmony, wonderful insights into social realities, memorable,\\ninnovative, brave (as for these times) MOMENTS. Fellini appears to draw\\na parallel between Cabiria\\'s experiences and everyone\\'s life. Consider,\\nfor instance, the main motifs why she goes to these different places:\\nshe wants to find herself, looks for happiness, looks for love. Does\\nshe find it? Difficult to say... I particularly loved the moment she is\\nso confused in a luxurious house of a famous film star, Alberto Lazzari\\n(Amedeo Nazzari), but, from the social point of view, so lucky to get\\nthe autograph of his. But does this autograph give her satisfaction? A\\ndifferent must see moment is the visit to the Sanctuary of the Amore\\nDivina - a pure realism of people in prayer trance shouting \"Grazie\\nMadonna!\" Cabiria seems to be touched by them but is she able to ask\\nMadonna for the right thing? Events are one factor why I really\\nappreciate this film.Another reason for my love to this movie are the top notch\\nperformances. The cast, particularly Giulietta Masina (foremost she),\\nmake NIGHTS OF CABIRIA nearly a masterpiece. Giulietta Masina patterns\\nher acting on purely original building block of cinema\\'s charm which is\\nFACE. That is where you can read her feelings, that is where you\\nrealize what is going on. As a matter of fact, dialog is only an\\nadditional aspect when applied to her. From portraying anger,\\ndisappointment, confusion, trance, hope, to affection, sorrow and yet\\nan optimistic smile, Giulietta is a marvel! I would not compare her\\nacting to the ones in other Fellini movies, including LA STRADA and\\nJULIET OF THE SPIRITS, because she is unique as Cabiria, the same as\\nshe is unique in the roles of Gelsomina or Giulietta! The supporting\\ncast also give fine performances, particularly Francois Perier as Oscar\\nD\\'Onofrio, Amedeo Nazzari as Alberto and Franca Marzi as Wanda,\\nseemingly Cabiria\\'s real friend.But for me what will always play a decisive role after seeing this\\nmovie is the specific Italian charm of long ago. This is something I\\nfound in many old Italian movies and and that is something Fellini\\nmanaged to entail here like other geniuses of cinema from his country.\\nThe film is nice to watch but not light to watch, it has reflections\\nbut also relaxation, all is in its right place. Moreover, all is\\nenriched by the wonderful music by Nino Rota, a genius with whom\\nFellini worked with many other movies.As one reviewer before me has already stated, NIGHTS OF CABIRIA is like\\nCabiria\\'s or Giulietta\\'s smile, the smile of optimism, the smile of\\nlong ago, the smile that after 50 years still moves us and uplifts us.\\nWhat was happiness for Cabiria? Was it the luxury she found in\\nAlberto\\'s life? Was it a group of pilgrims she joined? Was it Frate\\nGiovanni who insisted on maintaining the Grace of God? She illusively\\nfound her angel in D\\'Onofrio; yet the truth occurred entirely\\ndifferent. What is happiness for us? Have we found it or is it just like in\\nCabiria\\'s life...it passes by as such an unnoticeable, simple thing and\\nwe look for it and expect it in totally wrong places? Great movie as a\\nreal experience and touching empathy with the heroine. 9/10! If it\\'s\\none of the first Fellini\\'s films that you see, you\\'re on the right\\ntrack!\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nFederico Fellini directed his wife, Giuletta Masina, in some of her and\\nhis most memorable screen work. Nights of Cabiria may be high up there,\\nperhaps the most exciting. The film carries an episodic storyline that\\nfollows our heroine Cabiria as she has to use a hard act of cynicism\\nand street-wise attitude to cover up a girlyish interior. Run-ins with\\na celebritie and other louse-abouts, a visit to a church, and a\\nlife-changing bit on a magician's stage, and most of these sequences\\nare filmed superbly. Not only is there Fellini's usual under-current of\\nlaughs, but a perfect sense of imagination behind the on-location sets\\nand real-life actors.I've seen this and La Strada now (Masina's other notable work), and I\\nfeel a little more inclined to go with this one as the better. Some\\ncritics have written that Fellini's films, in the evolution of his\\ncareer, show a gaining momentum up till 8 1/2. Although I'd have to see\\nboth each a second go-around, Nights of Cabiria had me enthralled and\\namazed for the whole two hours. There's something so appealing about a\\ncharacter like Cabiria that's pulled off without a hitch, even into the\\nseemingly 'easy' third act. Add another fantastic Nina Rota score,\\nfascinating supporting cast, and a genuine ideology behind the\\nenvironment of Cabiria's world, and it's a winner. This is the kind of\\nfilm that COULD have appealed more so to women than men, but as it\\nstands, the film holds up as a great romantic character study for\\nanyone. A+\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nSpoilers herein.I suppose there are many who believe this to be a character study, or\\nperhaps social criticism. I don't think so -- I believe this to be Fellini's\\nfirst film concerned with the nature of what film is: part prostitution,\\npart promised miracle; part mesmerised fantasy; part romantic\\npretense.And that's how this film is constructed, four set pieces dealing with these\\nfour ideas:-- The film actor as reluctant prostitute-- The masses flocking to the madonna based on the magic of the ritual\\nperformance-- The audience being hypnotized by watching someone be\\nhypnotized-- The play that is behind love, and all it is, is a play for money (which\\nconnects to the small sequence in the beginning)This is definitely worth watching, and it has historical significance as\\nwell. But I think it s pretty weak Fellini so far as the visual elements and\\nthe narrative adventure. So many of the dramatic metaphors are peculiarly\\nItalian -- somehow they don't translate to the universal as well as say the\\nJapanese of Kurosawa.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nCabiria is a prostitute in her 30s. Short and not as pretty as her\\ncolleagues either. She lost her parents when she was little so she was\\nnever educated or cultured and you can see all this in her character.The first scene shows her being pushed into a river by her boyfriend\\n(pimp too I guess) who just wants to steal her handbag. She gets\\nrescued by some kids and some local people but when she wakes up she\\nabsolutely doesn't care about them and is very rude and bad to them.\\nShe has had such a hard life, a life where people just use her, a life\\nof no love or respect that most of her mind is just callous.But as we spend time with her, we slowly see that, just like anybody,\\nshe too just wants to be loved. But its subtle. She has been burned so\\nmany many times that trust is 'extremely' difficult for her.By the end of the movie, we will fall in love with her. You just want\\nto hug her close, kiss her and tell her that she is truly loved for who\\nshe and that she will not be harmed. That is how good the acting by\\nGiulietta Masina is (the story too). She has the most expressive eyes\\nthat I have seen on screen. If she was in Hollywood, she may have been\\none of the greatest actresses of all times! This movie is also not for\\neveryone. Its a sort of slice-of-life of just one person, so it doesn't\\nhave a conclusive ending. Its not a, she lived happily ever after or\\nshe died or she achieved that, kind of movie. And you really need to be\\nolder, seen pain, understood the meaning of loneliness, what society\\nis, what people want, etc., to see the heart and reason behind\\neverything.Movie is on the levels of Tokyo Story, so do see it.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nRome, 1957. A woman, Cabiria, is robbed and left to drown by her\\nboyfriend, Giorgio. Rescued, she resumes her life and tries her best to\\nfind happiness in a cynical world. Even when she thinks her struggles\\nare over and she has found happiness and contentment, things may not be\\nwhat they seem.Wonderfully engaging movie from Federico Fellini. There's a lightness\\nand sweetness about the main character that makes her easy to support.\\nSome great comedy too. It's not all wine-and-roses though. There is a fair amount of struggle,\\nbitterness and cynicism involved. The ending is particularly cynical,\\npossibly too cynical. I am generally not in favour of Hollywood,\\nhappily-ever-after, endings but this story deserved a bit more\\nhappiness and closure than it ended with.While Fellini pulls the strings to perfection, it is the performance of\\nGiulletta Masina as Cabiria who makes the movie. Street-wise and sassy\\nyet sweet and vulnerable. Very funny, yet able to convey great sadness\\nand struggle too. Some of her physical comedy is Chaplinesque in its\\nbrilliance. Her performance spans the whole gamut of human emotions and\\nexpressions and she does it incredibly well. Incredibly engaging and it\\nis this engagement that makes the movie so great.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nNIGHTS OF CABIRIA, Fellini sixth feature film, which marks that he has\\nassertively reached the full- blown phrase in his creativity and\\nsleight-of-hand at the age of 37, and anticipates the acme of his\\ncareer, LA VOLCE VITA (1960) and 8 AND A HALF (1963). The story (with\\nPasolini inside the coterie as a collaborator), is a tale of woe about\\na roadside streetwalker Cabiria (Masina) in Rome, whose real name is\\nMaria Ceccarelli.In the opening long shot, we see Cabiria gambols with his beau on a\\nSunny day in the field near a river, and quick as lightning, he grabs\\nher handbag and pushes her into the water. Cabiria is almost drowned,\\nthe same course of events will (almost) replicate itself in the\\narresting culmination, this time, with another suitor, a well-groomed\\nbut greasy self-claimed accountant Oscar (P\\xe9rier). Why Cabiria hasn\\'t\\nlearn anything from her miseries? It is much easier to shoot out\\npointers in post- mortem, in fact, as we audience follows closely to\\nthese non-interrelated episodes of Cabiria\\'s experiences, her wretched\\ndestiny doesn\\'t strike more like a subjectively injudicious decision\\nthan a fusillade of flak targeting at the injustice of contemporary\\nsociety and the worst of human vice.Cabiria is petite, petulant and starry-eyed, apart from a narrow escape\\nfrom death thanks to her dastard boyfriend, she is perfectly content in\\nher own achievement, her self-reliant means of earning secures her a\\nhouse of her own and some savings in the bank, even during her\\nserendipitous \"one-night-stand\" with a famous movie star, Alberto\\nLazzari (Nazzari in his Erroyl Flynn suaveness), in his palatial villa,\\nshe is not ashamed of her bog-standard house. Only when she peers from\\nthe keyhole of the star\\'s bathroom when Alberto romantically reconciles\\nwith his trophy girlfriend Jessy (Gray), she realises there is\\nsomething missing in her life.A pilgrimage with other working girls jolts her out of her hard earned\\nfulfilment, she transforms from a non-believer to a devotee, daydreams\\na miracle will bestow on her. After religious epiphany, next in line is\\nprestidigitation, Fellini cunningly alludes to the collusion between\\nthem, religion seduces a simple soul and illusion brings her the\\nundoing. In the hypnotic performance, a cynical Cabiria unwittingly\\nreveals herself, the inner child, a love-longing Maria Ceccarelli,\\nwhich instigates Oscar, a spectator in the audience to conspire his\\nact. Since manifestly Cabiria is not an accomplice of the magician\\n(Silvani), then her state-of-hypnosis is indeed real, which is boldly\\nagainst the common savvy, and can be perceived as a further tactic to\\nturn realness-and-illusion topsy-turvy, with the sudden arrival of a\\nPrince Charming, willing to marry her and doesn\\'t want to know anything\\nabout her past, only with an ulterior motive.Giulietta Masina, what can I say, such a godsend to her hubby, a force\\nof nature can effortlessly entice a viewer to vicariously discern and\\nundergo her character\\'s emotional trajectory, all the more she provoke\\nimmense sympathy along the way, the suspense-heightened final\\nrevelation is so gut-wrenching to watch yet it is completely\\ncaptivating and emotive (bolstered by Nino Rota\\'s sublimely emotionally\\nmanipulative score). What a triumphant performance, Cannes\\' BEST\\nACTRESS honour has never been so worthy!NIGHTS OF CABIRIA won BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE in the Oscar race,\\na consecutive second win for Fellini after LA STRADA (1954), unlike its\\ntragic protagonist Gesumina, also played by Masina, who succumbs to the\\nhardship and abandonment, in the coda, Cabiria manages to squeeze a\\nsmile through her tears with a parade of people singing and dancing\\naround her, like a phoenix back from the ash, the message is uplifting,\\nshe may be homeless and penniless, but she has a true friend Wanda (an\\nace Marzi, in her very naturalistic mien) to rely on, she can go on\\nworking the next day and start every from the scratch, what can not\\nkill you only makes you stronger, girl!

       " u'\\nA waifish prostitute (Giulietta Masina) wanders the streets of Rome\\nlooking for true love but finds only heartbreak.I do not feel confident critiquing this film, as it is the first\\nFederico Fellini film I have seen. Sure, one should be able to judge a\\nfilm on its own merits, but I feel like it would be more fair to put\\nthis one in context of his overall career, seeing as this was 55 years\\nago...Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, saying \"this one is aimed\\nmore surely toward the development of a theme than a plot. Its interest\\nis not so much the conflicts that occur in the life of the heroine as\\nthe deep, underlying implications of human pathos that the pattern of\\nher life shows... But there are two weaknesses in Cabiria. It has a\\nsordid atmosphere and there is something elusive and insufficient about\\nthe character of the heroine. Her get-up is weird and illogical for the\\nmilieu in which she lives and her farcical mannerisms clash with the\\nugly realism of the theme.\" I include this here merely to show how time\\nhas aged this film well -- no critic today would come down so harsh on\\nFellini.What I actually found most interesting was the producer being Dino De\\nLaurentiis. Now, that in itself is not strange, because he has produced\\na great many things (and other Fellini films). But again, looking back\\n50 years, Dino is known for his involvement in horror and science\\nfiction. It is interesting to see he had such a distinguished\\nbeginning. Most people in film start in horror and then go legit, not\\nthe other way around.\\n',\n",

I can't say it's on account of Masina; an actress of\\nwonderful talent. Because, in some of her other Fellini roles, she\\ndidn't come across as this stupendous. Then it must be what her\\nhusband, the inimitable Fellini did for her acting. That's more likely.\\nEveryone knows he was a genius. Giulietta Masina as Cabiria may have\\nbeen a stroke of that genius, matched with an unforgettable Nino Rota\\nfilm score, and the undying magic of Rome. Masina was a RIOT of\\nfeminine personality and rose to Fellini's greatest occasion in film.\\nAll the actors in this gem of a movie are splendid! Now; there is a lovely spiritual aspect to Nights of Cabiria. I suspect\\nhardly anybody in the millions who have seen Cabiria over many years\\nrealizes it. Now we'll have a spoiler with the secret aspect realized: Despite her facade of insouciance and exuberance; Cabiria is dejected\\nat the squalor of her prostitution; and how men have exploited her\\nonce-innocent youth. She reveals it for a fleeting moment. Before the\\nostensibly miraculous image of the Virgin, Cabiria breaks down and\\npleads: For a change in her hopeless life.In the following scenes, disappointment sets in. Both for her and\\nothers in the so-called pilgrimage. Her acting, of a slightly rummy\\nprostitute laughing at the notion of innocence and faith, becomes\\nliterally heartbreaking. Only Giulietta could have played these scenes.Rather than continue on the spoiler sequence and a final denouement; I\\nsuggest viewers hereafter pay attention during the much-admired ending.\\nEveryone knows by now she's leaving Rome. She's disposed of her\\nproperty and for love's sake Cabiria puts her past behind her. Then\\nwe're led to see her last agony toward the end. While Rota's absolutely\\nsmashing score is played by a group of adolescents, she sheds one last\\ntear and smiles into Fellini's camera. Because her prayer before the\\nVirgin is answered. It's been very painful, but her life has changed at\\nlast!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nI'm sure, like many, I first set eyes on the then Mrs Fellini, Giuletta\\nMasina, who stars as Cabiria, as the stray little clown in La Strada,\\nwho was sold to Anthony Quinn's cruel one-man performing act. I'm glad\\nthat I bought and viewed the two DVDs in this order.How the character developed in La Strada was extraordinarily compelling\\nand at its conclusion, I was in distress and tears. I was also in tears\\nat the end of Cabiria, for different reasons, of which I'll keep to\\nmyself, so as to not spoil for others.Cabiria, is a plucky little prostitute in a poor, run-down Rome area\\nwhose sassy lip and terrier like fight-back saves her bacon, many\\ntimes. From an attempted drowning at the start, to being a distracting\\nplaything for a film star who gets back with his mistress in front of\\nCabiria's eyes.There's always that fiery competition and catty dialogue one presumes\\nstreet-girls the world over are forever rattling off. Bettering\\nthemselves, moving on, meeting Mr Right etc. Her entanglements are\\ncounterbalanced by that other Fellini (La Dolce Vita especially)\\nfascination, the Catholic church. Cabiria isn't a fallen angel, just\\none that's stuck in a degrading and constricting 'profession', always\\nat the mercy of someone else.Eventually, she believes she meets her Intended-to-be. The immense joy\\nthat radiates from that wide-eyed face of hers then; but at other times\\ncan send rods of acute sadness through you in seconds just by a held\\nexpression. Maybe, she's the original Meryl Streep, in that, even\\nwithout dialogue, her face alone can express a whole scene. Direction\\nfrom one's husband obviously helps.Really very good films generally don't get more than a 9/10 from me.\\nThere is always a sliver of room for improvement in 99.9 of films. To\\nget a 10, it has to have a profound, personal effect on me. This did\\nand whilst not having any idea how the film was going to end, my\\nemotions went through every scenario - and back again. When it was in\\nan unexpected way, I just knew that it was the only way that Cabiria,\\nas we'd got to know her, and love her, WOULD have made it.This is an absolute must for anybody and everybody, who has a TV (or\\nPC, or Ipad, or whatever). I'm still bristling with feelings from it,\\n12 hours after seeing it.\\n\",\n",

It seems each time someone serious takes an interest\\nin her, it\\'s for some reason other than true love. I still haven\\'t seen\\ntoo many Fellini movies in my life but the ones I have seen have left\\nme rather cold even though I was highly impressed with the talent shown\\nin them. I was really looking forward to this one and as it would turn\\nout this here is my favorite that I\\'ve seen from the director so far. I\\nread quite a few reviews before watching this and each of them seemed\\nto have a different opinion on the film. Some called it a chic flick.\\nSome called it a black comedy. Some called it a depressing nightmare.\\nThe one thing I agreed most with was a critic who compared it to a\\nfemale version of Chaplin\\'s Little Tramp character. I think what works\\nso well about the film is that it contains a little bit of everything\\nand all of these emotions are perfectly pulled off by Masina who turns\\nin a masterful performance and really makes this character one of the\\nmost memorable female roles in film history. I think she perfectly\\nnails the darker side of the comedy in scenes like the beginning when\\nshe returns home after her \"true love\" trying to drown her by pushing\\nher in the lake. The scene with her on the bed is so sad it\\'s\\nhilarious. I think she also does a great job in terms of being a woman\\nsimply wanting love. The innocence of this dream really comes across as\\nsomething very touching and something we want her to find. Then, there\\nare the darker moments that I won\\'t ruin but she again nails these\\nperfectly. There have been countless films with women playing\\nprostitutes and quite often people joke that this is the type of role\\nany actress would want to play and I can\\'t help but wonder if that\\nfeeling started here. I guess it goes without saying that Masina was\\noverlooked at the Oscars this year. Fellini\\'s touch is also on hand and\\nI thought that for the most part he kept the film moving very well,\\nalthough I didn\\'t care too much for the scene that was added to prints\\nin 1998 with the mysterious man delivering the blankets. Outside of\\nthis scene the director handles the various emotions quite well and the\\nbeautiful photography really jumps out at one.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n'Le notti di Cabiria' is a wonderful film who survived very well the\\nhalf century since it was made and can be seen today with the same\\nemotion. Much of the secret of this survival over time is due to the\\nsplendid creation of Giulietta Masina, who in the role of Cabiria\\ncreates one of these universal characters that belongs to the family of\\nChaplin's Charlot - a woman who dreams to overcome her condition and\\nkeeps her humanity and her determination despite the repeated hits that\\nlife and destiny pour on her. Over an over again she is brought to\\nbelieve that she can reach absolution and happiness, by means of\\ndreams, by means of people, by means of religion, yet every tie she is\\ndeceived, just to raise again and get back to fighting life with her\\nunforgettable smile among tears. The film is very well made, and\\nrepresents a milestone of the evolution of Fellini from the\\nneorealistic films of the first part of his career to the more\\nsophisticated and aesthetic movies of the next decades.

       " u\"\\nBefore Federico Fellini became the audacious and surrealistic film\\nauteur of the 1960s he was a lauded and accomplished Italian\\nNeorealistic film director of the 1950s, more in league with Vittorio\\nDe Sica and Lucchino Visconti, and no film better represents this era\\nof Fellini's art than his sterling 1957 film Nights Of Cabiria (Le\\nNotti Di Cabiria), written by Fellini, Tulio Pinelli, and Ennio Flaiano\\n(with Pier Paolo Pasolini scripting the Roman street slang), and\\nstarring his wife Giulieta Masina. It won the 1957 film Oscar for Best\\nForeign Film, and deservedly so. The film deals with the trials and\\ntribulations of the impoverished and downtrodden in a humorous but\\nrealistic way that Hollywood still does not dare to do. Yet, even in\\nthis film, one can see the filmmaker that Fellini was to become in a\\nfew years, for, despite its seeming realism, there are many neat\\ntouches of Absurdism, Symbolism, and Surrealism\\x85. In many ways, the\\nfilm is a picaresque of one of the oldest clich\\xe9s: the hooker with the\\nheart of gold, but such a generalization utterly disservices the 'how'\\nof how art affects one, and how it does its task. Masina's brilliant\\nperformance, which won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film\\nFestival, is often compared to Chaplin's tramp character, even though\\nit is more like Lucille Ball's TV character of Lucy Ricardo, from I\\nLove Lucy, albeit with depth, delicacy, and heart; such a depth of a\\ncharacter that a lesser actress would have let descend into burlesque.\\nYet, Cabiria's expressiveness is more subtle and true than either\\nChaplin's or Ball's characters, for they exist only in comedies, and\\nNights Of Cabiria is not a comedy, despite some funny moments. Cabiria\\nexists in a far more complex and realistic world than the Tramp or Lucy\\nRicardo. Her face contorts into twists of pain Lucy Ricardo never\\ndreamt of, and which the Tramp simply shrugged off, or responded to\\nwith wild slapstick. Cabiria is wary, mistrusts, and does not seem to\\nlearn, frustrating both her and the audience she has gotten to root for\\nher. I knew many such women in my New York neighborhood while growing\\nup. And they can be tough, street smart, yet still gullible enough to\\nfall for an Oscar. That said, critics have disagreed, over the years,\\nover whether or not Oscar was conning Cabiria from the start. I think\\nit's clear he was, for from her answers to the mesmerist he felt she\\nwas an independent woman of means, assuming a poor woman would never\\neven go to such a show. One can even see from their scene of meeting at\\nthe train station that Oscar is putting on an act, changing his facial\\nexpressions the moment he sees her, dropping a toothpick from his\\nmouth, after looking like the consummate con man, and then assuming a\\nweak demeanor to lure Cabiria into his trap. That the woman who makes\\nher living in sex is still so na\\xefve to the ways of emotional sexual\\ninvolvement says a lot of Fellini's prescience in parsing out realities\\nof character development. Then, when he found out she was a prostitute,\\nhe felt a bit guilty, as if preying on someone from his own class, and\\nthus wanted to not know of her 'job'. A part of him, it seems, wants to\\nnot con her, at the cliff, and this was why his demeanor is so\\ndifferent. Yet, ultimately, he's a con, she's a whore, and reality\\ndictates they act their parts. But, unlike Giorgio, he is no would be\\nkiller. The only question is what his initial con was to be- to marry a\\nwoman of means, and then, failing that, to just take Cabiria's money\\nthe moment he saw it, knowing his original plan was dead, for he could\\nnot sponge off of her. Such small ambiguities, even if not pertinent to\\nCabiria's ultimate unhappiness, nor the film's ending, makes Fellini an\\nartist of the first rank, for only such artists pay attention to such\\nthings. These things, not the great things, are often the difference\\nbetween greats and minor artists.These sorts of subtleties in common folk are never even broached, much\\nless dealt with, in modern Hollywood films. Such is the richness of\\nthis marvelous study in class and self-deception, where humans live in\\nsmall concrete boxes they call homes, as if lab rats. That the film\\ndoes not follow a conventional narrative format is a good thing, for it\\nheightens the realistic sense of the film. It also subtly repudiates\\nreligion, although not so much in the overtly religious scenes, where\\nCabiria's spiritual entreaties go unheard, nor where she mocks the\\nreligiots as fools, but in those scenes where Cabiria reveals her most\\nhuman side, the non-fantastic, which is ironic, since she works in a\\nprofession that deals with fantasy. The film also deals with survival,\\nat its basest level, for Cabiria barely grows intellectually through\\nthe film. Yes, by film's end, one could argue that her latest user and\\nabuser, Oscar, is a step up from Giorgio, whom she began the film with,\\nbut has Cabiria really ameliorated?To close, Nights Of Cabiria owes much to City Lights for its focus on\\nthe poor, as well as to De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, for its realistic\\nview of life at a certain time and place, especially its end, which\\nsimply ends, with no indication of whether or not Cabiria will be\\nbetter off or not, and this helps viewers more strongly identify with\\nher, because we all are unknowing and uncertain of our futures, and\\neven though Cabiria's uncertainty is half a century removed, the tingle\\nwe get in our bellies, at the film's end is a recognition of our fears\\nin her gaze toward us, and despite it's unsettling effect, such\\nbutterflies still flap their wings for the future.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nEver since I was bored to tears by both 8 1/2 and La Dolce Vita;\\nFederico Fellini hasn't been at the top of my favourite directors list.\\nHowever, he went up a little in my estimation after I saw La Strada,\\nand Night of Cabiria ensures that my opinion of him has risen further\\nstill. The film is a very bleak portrayal of the life of a young woman\\nin Italy, who becomes the victim of several men; but isn't completely\\nblameless herself. The film starts with a sequence that sees this\\nwoman, named Cabiria, dumped into a river shortly before her purse is\\nstolen by her supposed 'love'. Any sympathy we have for her is quickly\\nlost after she is rescued by some helpful villagers, and proceeds to\\nmock their rescue by being very rude indeed. The central character is\\nvery hard to like, as she's seriously lacking in good points; but this\\nseems to be the point of the movie. Cabiria doesn't treat others very\\nwell, and as such; she doesn't get a good deal very often herself. The\\ncharacter is never really allowed to develop - she always has the same\\nmotives, but her situation changes around her - and Fellini gives us a\\ncinematic interpretation of the old proverb 'a leopard never changes\\nits spots'.The film takes place largely in the downtrodden areas of Rome. Fellini\\ndoes an excellent job of enforcing the character's situation on his\\naudience, and the black and white cinematography helps to ensure that\\nthe movie always looks suitably bleak. This film represents a reunion\\nbetween director Federico Fellini and his La Strada star Giulietta\\nMasina. Masina delivers an energetic performance, which ensures that\\nthe film is never boring; but it also means that her character often\\nappears over the top, and the film loses credibility because of that.\\nTo be honest, I don't think this actress suits the film too well. She\\nfit her role in La Strada like a glove, and it may be for that reason\\nthat she is hard to accept in such a different persona. Anyway, the\\nstyle of the film is great; Fellini ensures that the film feels very\\nItalian, and this combined with the energy from the lead makes the film\\nmore enjoyable than quite a few similar art films. The ending is great,\\nand fits everything leading up to it brilliantly. This is the only way\\nthe film could have ended properly; making the climax both fitting and\\nsatisfying. Overall, Nights of Cabiria is an excellent classic film and\\none that I recommend to fans of art cinema.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\n(Some spoilers below)\\nThis film is about illusions, and how everybody - individuals,\\ngovernments,\\nperformers, religions, actors, prostitutes, film directors - exploits\\nthem\\nfor their own ends. Some do so in ways which are harmful to others. Some,\\nlike Cabiria, harm themselves.Fellini\\'s examination of illusion draws on a rich tradition, particularly\\nin\\nEuropean theatre (the dominance of \"seeming\" over \"being\", illusion and\\ndeception over honesty, goes right back to Hamlet and beyond).The film is structured around a series of expositions of illusion,\\ninvolving\\na bogus lover, a famous actor, a pilgrimage, a variety show, and,\\nfinally,\\nto close the circle...a bogus lover again. Add in the fact that the\\ncentral\\ncharacter is a prostitute...I think you\\'re starting to get the\\npicture.So if all is illusion, why watch the film? Because the central purveyor\\n(and, more importantly, victim) of illusion (the prostitute Cabiria) is a\\nconvincingly-portrayed, complex character who exhibits a tough,\\nlife-affirming drive to take on the world (in the best Camusian, post-war\\nexistentialist sense). It is this that makes the film such an\\nexhilarating\\nexperience. Millions of people in Italy and all over Europe in the 1940\\'s\\nand 1950\\'s had to live in a world which had utterly collapsed. In this\\nworld, one did what one could to get by, and religion, love, sensual\\npleasure, and, of course, the cinema, offered only brief respite from the\\neveryday realities.The classic neo-realist edge-of-city building-site sets add the requisite\\ntouch of alienation and barrenness to the action.\\nBut this is not the kind of hardline neo-realist tract satirized by\\nNichetti\\nin \"The Icicle Thief\". Fellini\\'s natural sense of cinema as fantasy\\nenables\\nthe viewer to feel good at the end of a film where no conventional\\nfeelgood\\nfactor is offered. And surely that\\'s an achievement in\\nitself.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nIn this masterpiece by a great director, Fellini tells of the prostitute\\nCabiria who spends the entire movie searching for love without ever actually\\nhaving sex.  I know what you\\'re thinking: \"Ra-ra; that sounds boring. Wrong.At the heart of this film is a feminist who is coming into her own.  The\\naudience feels her heartbreak as she goes from man to man looking for \"the\\none.\"  As a guy, I must say that I started to hate men.  I guess that\\'s sort\\nof the point.  Cabiria\\'s character is essentially an innocent, and it is\\nhard to watch people take advantage of innocents (and innocence).  Well\\nFellini makes you sit through it, and the effect is awesome.When it finally seems as if Cabiria has found the right man, the viewer\\ncannot help but to be wary after all of the s**t she had to go through with\\nthe others.  Is the viewer right?  What do you think?The final shot gives me chills (the good kind).  It stands as a testament to\\nthe independence of womankind and their strength to persevere when they are\\nleft with nothing.Awesome.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nWith her short stature, small round face, big eyes, and ponytail,\\nCabiria makes for a memorable character. And actress Giulietta Masina\\nplays the part well. She exudes emotional depth, and an abundance of\\nanimated expressions. But through most of the film, Cabiria\\'s attitude\\nis too belligerent to render her sympathetic. Yes, she has lots to\\ncomplain about. But early in the film, we don\\'t know that. And the\\nexpressiveness that makes her so endearing in the last Act makes her\\ncallous at the start.\"Nights Of Cabiria\" is a typical Fellini film, in that it lacks basic\\nplot structure. Instead of weaving a unified story from an underlying\\npremise, the film mostly presents viewers with a series of unrelated\\nvignettes. We see Cabiria in varying situations, and how she reacts to\\nan assortment of secondary characters. But these vignettes are\\npresented in structural isolation. Only toward the end does Fellini\\nbegin to connect the dots, and thereby compose a cinematic portrait\\nthat is thematically coherent.Not only does the screen story lack structure, the dialogue is\\nmaddeningly talky. And again, most of the chatter is battling and\\nargumentative. It gets stale, quickly.Visually, the film looks great. The B&W cinematography conveys\\nwonderful lighting contrast, especially in the nighttime scenes, along\\nwith a variety of camera angles and interesting compositions. The\\nbackground music also contributes to the film\\'s artistic feel.Overall, however, the film\\'s structural weakness, the expressed\\nhostility, and the talky dialogue burden the film to the point that I\\njust can\\'t recommend it, except to viewers who naturally gravitate to\\nFellini\\'s unorthodox style of film-making.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nFederico Fellini\\'s \"Nights of Cabiria\" is of all his films perhaps the\\nmost representative of the filmmaker and his art - it displays his\\ncinematic genius, his ability to draw out fantastic performances from\\nactors, his deluge of empathy, and his greatest weakness. Allow me to\\nexplain; for Fellini, much of life and art are a circus. This can be\\nseen in the comic touch of \"I Vitteloni\", the farcically random events\\nof \"8 1/2\", and in the three-ring music of Nina Rota. The theme of life\\nas a circus is all very well, but it sometimes leaves you hanging - as\\nif the movie will continue forever but you, the viewer, will not. This\\nis the problem with \"Nights of Cabiria\" - it is the tale of a young\\nprostitute who is trying to find some kind of salvation. She at first\\ntries to find it in boyfriend, moves on to a movie star, then attempts\\nto attain it through religion, and finally tries to discover it in love\\n- but salvation seems forever out of reach, for each of those things\\nlisted above ultimately fail her, and thus the movie fails to really\\nend; it simply goes on piping and marching as the viewer sits wondering\\nwhere s/he is left. For these reasons, \"Nights of Cabiria\" doesn\\'t\\nfully work; but this is not to damn it, for it is for the most part a\\nheart-wrenching, beautiful, and powerful film. 7.5/10\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nOf course, \"Le Notti di Cabiria\" is a superior work compared to the American\\nmusical remake \"Sweet Charity,\" but will I be laughed out of the room if I\\nwere to say that, in some small ways, I actually prefer \"Charity\" over\\n\"Cabiria\"? To explain exactly why would mean blowing several major plot\\npoints in both movies - suffice it to say that, IMHO, the character played\\nby John McMartin in the remake is an improvement over his Italian\\ncounterpart; his motivations are more complicated and, I think, more\\ncredible.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nIt is almost considered heretic to write something negative about\\nFellini. As a matter of fact, Fellini succeeded to create an ambient of\\nadoration around him like possibly no other film director ever.\\nHowever, all is not gold that glitters.In Fellini\\'s \"Cabiria\" we see some whores of Rome, although they are\\nbitterly poor and misused by their pimps, jumping and dancing in the\\nstreets, merrily laughing, having fun with drinks and food all together\\nenjoying their lives. Even the pimps are there, and if something bad\\nhappens than it is a curse or a smashed car-door, not more. And when\\nthey fight, it is less harmful than amongst children. Even in one of\\nthe last scenes, where an old whore is shown who must live in an\\nearth-cave: she is happy, and as long as the angel provides her with\\nfood, she thanks god that she is allowed to have such a miserable\\nexistence. Fellinis whores have no diseases, and when they suffer, than\\nbecause of loneliness and not from hunger, gonorrhea and bloody limbs.It is hard to believe, yet true, that the screenplay of this movie was\\nwritten by Pier Paolo Pasolini, by the same Pasolini who portrayed the\\nworld of the whores of Romes in a quite different way than Fellini did.\\nIn film theory, one tries to absorb this difference by a notion of\\ntime: Fellini is \"realistic\", Pasolini is \"neo-realistic\". In\\nliterature one would speak about the difference between realism and\\nnaturalism, and in truth one has to speak about the difference between\\nthe blissful stupidity of Fellini who by guarantee never has made a\\nstep down to Ostia and Pasolini who lived there and was killed there.\\nPasolini\\'s \"Mamma Roma\" is not a childish grinning clown-esquire puppet\\nlike Masina\\'s \"Cabiria\" with her school-girlish white socks, but the\\nAcademy Award went to Fellini\\'s wife and not to Anna Magnani. Clearly,\\nFellini who resided on one of the 7 hills of Rome made the money,\\nPasolini was 36 times before court and was poor almost like his friends\\nin Ostia.This is bitterly sad because it is objectively false. One of the main\\nreasons why the big earthquake came in film in the Sixties, called\\n\"Nouvelle Vague\", \"Neue Welle\" of \"New Wage\" is that film makers in\\nwhole Europe were fed up with rose-red lies, conformism, idealistic\\nprosthetics of fascism and other wonderful post-war achievements. In\\nGermany, Fassbinder ended brutally the \"Schulm\\xe4dchen-Report\"- and\\n\"Lederhosen\"-culture. In France, the \"grandfather of Nouvelle Vague\",\\nJean-Pierre Melville, lead the level of the French gangster film up to\\nthat of the best American Film Noirs. And it Italy? In Italy where the\\nfascism was almost more popular after than during World War II,\\nsupported by the Catholic church, Fellini continued his artificial\\nsugar-sweet artistic, astonishingly untouchable by any critique who\\nwanted to make film besides Fellini. Less than 20 years after \"Cabiria\"\\nwas released under his own collaboration, Pasolini knew only one answer\\nto the deplorable and miserable intellectual situation in Italy: his\\ngigantic masterpiece \"Salo\" (1975).\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nWhile I used to hate the films of Fellini, I have recently seen several\\nmore and re-seen a few and have a greater appreciation for the\\ndirector. In particular, I did not like LA STRADA the first time, but\\nnow think it is a wonderful film and his earlier \"forgotten\" films are\\nexceptional. My particular favorite of all his films is the segment he\\ndid for BOCCACCIO 70--it was very surreal and hilarious. However,\\ndespite my increased appreciation, I STILL don\\'t particularly like Le\\nNOTTI di CABIRIA--though I liked it a little more the second time\\nbecause at least I could see that it was technically well-made.\\nHowever, the story itself of a prostitute who wants to be loved and\\ncared for is unrelentingly awful and depressing--so much so that I\\nnever want to see it again. Part of this might be because I am more a\\nromantic at heart and part of it is that I just feel the film is wildly\\noverrated. Sure, Giulietta Masina did a fine job--she was a fine\\nactress (as well as Fellini\\'s wife), but this doesn\\'t make the movie.\\nThe problem is that the movie is so unrelentingly realistic and grim.\\nSure, in real life prostitutes don\\'t find love and are often\\nabused--but do I really have to see this movie to know this?! The film\\nstarts with Masina getting beaten up and nearly killed by her\\n\"boyfriend\" and the film ends much the same way. Everything else in\\nbetween is leading us to believe that this inevitable ending might not\\noccur, but it does. Now I am not saying I want a vacuous and insipid\\nfilm about a prostitute with a heart of gold--after all, my review for\\nPRETTY WOMAN was savage (I truly, truly hated that movie). But other\\nthan a grim lesson that life sucks, I really can\\'t see why I would\\nrecommend this film. It\\'s good, but not at all pleasant. For people\\nthat can stand all the emotional pain, you may like it a lot more than\\nme--I just want something a little more uplifting and likable.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI fail to understand why a group of people connected with the \"Partito\\nComunista Italiano\" decided to turn the neo-realism into some kind of\\n\"blessed are the idiots, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven\"...To me, Federico Fellini tried to imitate the contemporary \"R\\xe9alisme\\nPo\\xe9tique\" of France, but he had not the dramatic writing powers of say\\n\"Jacques Pr\\xe8vert\". Fellini\\'s approach to the cinema is that a drawer or\\npainter, that\\'s where he started. He had then to find partners to write\\nthe script and found only third class ones.The great writers of WWII times in Italy like Moravia, Caesare Pavese\\nand others were not invited, or refused...Fellini was never an active\\nfighter of Mussolini...The result is that Fellini\\'s movies have no dramatic structure... They\\nare mere vignettes. The musical equivalent is Moussourgski\\'s \"Pictures\\nat an Exhibition\". This became a masterpiece only after Maurice Ravel\\norchestrated it to perfection..In films like \"La Dolce Vita\" and \"Otto et Mezzo\" this lack of dramatic\\nstructure is quite acceptable. In Amarcord, which is my favorite\\nFellini\\'s movie, it is not needed, because it is so close to the truth\\nas a documentary , rings so true and therefore becomes beautiful.But in Cabiria it is badly needed and is missing..When Amedeo Nazzari, in bed, after drinking champagne, prefers to\\nlisten to Beethoven\\'s 5th instead of making love to Cabiria, who he\\ndoes not wish to humiliate, on the contrary, this is the work of guys\\nthat know nothing about whores, women or the meaning of Beethoven\\'s\\n5th.The ending sequence is stupidly pathetic.No wonder that the OIC (Vatican\\'s Movies Office) gave this a prize.Fellini kind of redeemed himself next year in \"La Dolce Vita\" dressing\\nAnita Ekberg as a \"Putana Monsignore\". It was too late..\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI cannot figure out what the other reviewers on this site found here to\\npraise so highly. This film portrays Italians as bickering, violent,\\nselfish dolts.

It is like\\nwatching an eighth grade Italian Kabuki presentation.I have seen and enjoyed many Fellini films.

Not this turkey.\\nCabiria would have done better to have drowned, as was threatened in\\nthe opening scene. Of course she was saved (or there would be no movie)\\nand promptly chews out her rescuers.

Of all his characters, Fellini\\nonce said, Cabiria was the only one he was still worried about.

It\\'s\\nnot just the amazing perfomance by Giullietta Masina, it\\'s not just the\\nwonderful, semi-crazy characters wondering around the screen and\\nemphasizing\\nKabiria\\'s sad and lonely world, it\\'s -and that\\'s the film\\'s greatest\\nquality- this sense of optimism that Fellini wants the viewer to take with\\nhim/her as he/she is leaving the theater.

       " u'\\nFederico Fellini, the genius of the Italian cinema left his imprint in\\nall the films he directed for all of us to enjoy forever. \"Le Notti di\\nCabiria\" stands as one of his best because of the character of that\\ninvincible woman at the center of the story: Cabiria! Having recently\\nseen the excellent copy that was shown at NY\\'s Film Forum, this is a\\nfilm that like good wine gets better with age.Fellini was the man whose idea was translated for the screen with his\\nusual collaborators, Tulio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano. Pier Paolo\\nPassolini contributed to some of the dialog. Essentialy, this is a\\ntimeless tale of a woman that despite adversity, bad times, and all\\nthat is wrong around her, keeps her chin up and never begrudges a\\nthing. In fact, Cabiria, despite of her profession, is a woman with a\\nhighly moral character.The film takes us back to another, more innocent era. We are shown a\\nprostitute with a heart of gold who is always cheated by most of the\\nmen who comes in contact with her. Cabiria is never resentful, or\\nbitter at the hand life throws her way.One of the best realized sequences of the film involves Cabiria being\\npicked up by a handsome and popular actor, Alberto Lazzari. Alberto is\\nabout the only one in the movie that treats Cabiria with any semblance\\nof warmth. Unfortunately, nothing happens between them because\\nAlberto\\'s lover, the gorgeous Jessy, arrives at Alberto\\'s apartment to\\nclaim what\\'s hers, leaving Cabiria shut up in a bathroom. If only her\\nfriends could see her then! Nobody would believe it!There is not a moment out of place in the film. Of course, Fellini had\\nthe incomparable Giulietta Masina playing the leading role. Ms. Masina\\nis just too wonderful for words. She makes us believe she is Cabiria,\\nand that\\'s that, which in itself it\\'s something other actresses try\\nharder, without the same results. Ms. Masina\\'s face reveals all that is\\ngoing on within Cabiria. Together with all her other creations in other\\nFellini\\'s films, this is perhaps her own triumph as an actress.Franca Marzi, who plays Cabiria\\'s best friend, is also excellent.\\nAmadeo Nazzari is perfect portraying the matin\\xe9e idol, Alberto Lazzari.\\nThis was one of his best appearances in a distinguished career in the\\nItalian cinema. The rest of the cast is wonderful.Fellini\\'s masterpiece is a film that satisfies any time one sees it\\nthanks to his vision and the presence of Giulietta Masina.\\n',\n",

The intensity of the\\nbuild-up, the virtuosic camera work, the faces of the pious, are all\\nbreathtaking.I love the famed scene in the sleazy theatre where Cabiria, at the\\nhands of an unscrupulous hypnotist, relives a tender and poignant scene\\nfrom her youth in front of a crowd of louts.I love the scenes in and around Cabiria\\'s Ostia Road hovel, and the\\nlittle boys who climb giant Jungle Jims and call out her name, and she\\nwaves back.I love Cabiria\\'s friend Wanda (Franca Marzi), whom she loves dearly.\\nShe is a million times less vulnerable that our heroine and takes\\nCabiria\\'s rants with gracious generosity.I love the scene of that night Cabiria spends in the luxurious villa of\\na movie star (Amedeo Nazzari.)

And I love the overwhelming and moving finale, when Cabiria is robbed\\nby water once more, this time by a cruel scammer feigning love and for\\nwhom Cabiria was ready to start life anew.

       " u'\\n\\nI am not much in favor of \"best\" lists--I wouldn\\'t make\\nit\\nin Cusack\\'s \"High Fidelity\" world--but I can usually offer\\na range of titles of films that I consider the most powerful\\nexperiences I have had in front of a screen--Bicycle Thief,\\nRan, Ordet, Seventh Seal, Citizen Kane, L\\'Avventura, \\nRear Window, Blade Runner, quite a few others.  But if\\nI\\nhad to pick just one title, it would be Nights of Cabiria.\\nI saw it when it first came out in this country--I was\\na junior in high school and fortunate enough to live near\\na theater that showed foreign films.  It ran for several\\nweeks and I kept going back to see it over and over, giving\\nmyself permission by dragging friends to see it.  No one\\nwas\\never disappointed, though only a couple of friends developed\\na comparable enthusiasm with mine. I have continued to seeit every chance I get, though I have not had the opportunity\\nto\\nsee the latest reissue--I probably will have to see it onvideo or dvd, since the city I now live in rarely shows\\nany\\nforeign films.  Giulietta Massina gives not just the greatestperformance of her career, but surely one of the greatestperformances ever recorded on film, and the sequence of\\nCabiria\\'s experiences, at first seemingly random and \\ninsignificant, adds up to one of the most profound statements\\nFellini ever made about human life.  \\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis is one of the most perfect films ever committed to celluloid. It\\ninvolved me more than at least 99% of other films I've seen, and the main\\ncharacter, Cabiria, is a character to cherish and love forever (of course,\\nwe who have seen La Strada are already partly familiar with the character).\\nI've hardly ever cared more about a character, and even after only five\\nminutes into the film, I wanted so desperately to protect her. Giulietta\\nMasina is so masterful in her performance, and Federico Fellini, her\\nhusband, is as masterful in his direction. I did not believe that they could\\nmatch their success with La Strada, but, in fact, they succeeded in\\nsurpassing it. Bravo. 10/10. One of the best films ever made, plain and\\nsimple. \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\n\\tA prostitute whose life is a veritable study in the resilience of the human\\nspirit is the subject of `Nights of Cabiria,' directed by Federico Fellini. \\nGiulietta Masina stars as Cabiria, a gentle soul at heart who manages to\\nmaintain a positive outlook even in the face of adversity.  Experiences that\\nwould leave those of lesser mettle jaded she is seemingly able to ward off\\nand emerge from intact, with a guarded optimism that nevertheless leaves her\\nopen to whatever ills life may have in store for her next.  But it is just\\nthat optimism and her sense of joy in the simple things that makes her so\\nendearing.  She is proud, for example, of the fact that she owns her own\\nhouse, hovel though it may be.  Though not one to be easily duped, she is\\nvulnerable to sincere persistence, which has in the past rendered her victim\\nto those who would take advantage of her, which is succinctly established in\\nthe opening scene of the film. \\n\\tFellini's film is a study of how good may succumb to evil, and yet still\\ntriumph in the end (though open to subjective interpretation).  It's\\nsomething of an examination of endurance; how many times can one be knocked\\ndown before finally being unable to stand back up again.  At the same time,\\nhowever, it's an example of how purity can prevail against even the utmost\\ncruelty.  There is a humanity manifested in Cabiria that somehow gives\\nabsolution, not only to her lifestyle, but to those who would willingly do\\nher harm.  And it is in that very same absolution that we find a message of\\nhope and redemption.  \\n\\tAs Cabiria, the diminutive Masina gives a performance that is nothing less\\nthan superlative, filled with nuance and expression.  She has a face and a\\nmanner that convey an unbelievable depth of emotion, and Fellini captures\\nevery bit of it with his camera to perfection.  It sometimes seems that she\\nis a sprite merely masquerading as a woman; she has a light, almost ethereal\\npresence, though at the same time she exhibits an earthy quality that gives\\nher character such complexity, which removes any semblance of stereotype one\\nmay assign to her character as a `lady of the evening.'  It is a heartfelt,\\nmemorable portrayal that quite simply should have earned her an Oscar for\\nBest Actress.  Turning in a noteworthy performance, also, is Francois\\nPerier, as Oscar D'Onofrio, the stranger who comes into Cabiria's life with\\nan offer that ultimately seems too good to be true.\\n\\tThe supporting cast includes Amedeo Nazzari (Alberto Lazzari), Aldo Silvani\\n(The Hypnotist), Franca Marzi (Wanda), Dorian Gray (Jessy), Mario Passante\\n(Cripple in the `Miracle' sequence), Pina Gualandri (Matilda), Leo Cattozzo\\n(Man with the sack) and Polidor (The Monk).  `Nights of Cabiria' is a film\\nof extraordinary depth that is beautiful as well in it's humanity; Fellini\\nhas created images, both visually and emotionally, that are stunning and\\nindelibly realized.  Highlighted by the performance of Giulietta Masina,\\nthis is a film that begs to be embraced, one that will stay with you long\\nafter the last shadow has passed from the screen into darkness.  In Cabiria,\\nFellini somehow touches something eternal, for there is a lasting sense of\\ninnate goodness about her that simply cannot be forgotten.  For seekers\\nafter wisdom and truth, this is definitely a film that must not be missed. \\nI rate this one 10/10.   \\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nAs a film-lover, there are movies that I\\'ve outgrown, movies that\\ndisappointingly lose their connection to me as I age and mature. Fellini\\'s\\n\"Le Notti di Cabiria\" is one of those movies that seems to grow with me. It\\ngrows richer with each yearly viewing. I never tire of it; I am moved in\\ndifferent ways each time I see it. Fellini and his amazing muse, Giulietta\\nMasina, created one of those rare movie masterpieces in 1957 that comments\\non its time, yet remains fresh and contemporary as well. But I lament that\\nthis gem is so little known today. I trust its recent restoration will help\\nremedy the movie-going public\\'s oversight. The film\\'s rich concluding scene\\nalone (and Masina\\'s glance into our eyes) remains one of the most magical\\nmoments ever projected on a screen.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nGorgeous early Fellini, often considered the mid-point in his career,\\nbetween the more obviously reflective, supposedly realistic early work,\\nand\\nthe bleak extravaganzas that followed.  But Fellini was never a\\nneo-realist\\nin the dull way Rossellini was: his use of landscape was always heavily\\nsymbolic or subjective.  Here Cabiria lives in the middle of a bleak\\nwasteland, which perhaps serves to figure the emptiness of her life, the\\nsterility of life for women in macho Italy, or a comment on post-fascist\\nItaly itself.It doesn't really matter.  The sentiments of the film are actually quite\\ntrite - women are treated badly in Italy, etc.  What's riveting and\\nastonishing is not the experiences of Everywoman, but the experiences of\\none\\nparticular woman.  Although there is a great variety of locales, and\\nCabiria\\nseems to be always moving forward, the film is actually a melodrama.\\nCabiria never escapes, whatever her adventures, wherever she goes, she\\nalways ends up where she started, at home.  Even when she finally sells\\nher\\nhome for a supposed new life, her last (in the film; we just know the\\ncircle\\nwill never be broken) mirrors her first in a depressing\\ncircularity.Yet the film, for all its melancholy, is anything but depressing.  Fellini\\nis most famous for being an indulger of frail male egos, but CABIRIA's\\nstrength lies in its imaginative sympathy with its heroine.  The film's\\nstructure mirrors her situation - the film has no plot as such, just an\\naccumulative series of self-contained episodes which follow the same\\npattern: escape, hope, betrayal.  In each episode, the further Cabiria\\nmoves\\naway form her 'neo-realist' base, the more dream-like (verging on the\\nfantastic) the film becomes, as if she is stepping into an enchanted world\\n(this is made literal when she follows the actor into the nightclub, like\\nsome mythic warrior entering the dragon's lair).  And each time she gives\\ninto the dream world, the illusion is rudely shattered -  the scene at the\\nhypnotist's is as heartbreaking as anything in CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT.  So\\nwhile\\nthe reality/illusion dichotomy is facile as an idea, it is extraordinarily\\npowerful as cinema experienced through character.Fellini's filming is as beautiful as anything in 50s cinema, that decade\\nmirabilis: more restrained and grounded than later, with less obvious\\nflourish, but the mixture of realism and dream is made all the more\\nconvincing with the gentle, coaxing camera movements, beguiling us as well\\nas the heroine, but with the strange editing, and sometimes disruptive\\ncomposition giving us a distance she can never have.Giuletta Masina gives the most sublime performance by an actress in\\nItalian\\ncinema- an exuberant mixture of hope and resignation; her gorgeous big\\neyes\\nnot quite ready to give up yet, even at the end, although the submitting\\nto\\nthe youthful racket seems as hopelessly bleak as 8 1/2.  Her seemingly\\nunprepossessing body is actually an instrument of unparalelled grace, and\\nthe comparisons with Chaplin are not unwarranted - when you see this\\nperformance you'll realise how unexpressive most actors' bodies\\nare.The Chaplin model is not always helpful - there is a mawkishness and\\nemotional manipulation towards the climax that almost grates, but by then\\nyou so adore Cabiria, and so hate everybody else that thought doesn't\\nreally\\ncome into it (although doesn't it seem that many male viewers seem to\\nprefer\\nher as helpless).  Throw in a lovely, playful Nino Rota score and you're\\nin\\nmovie heaven.\\n\",\n",

He purposefully played it that way to draw the viewer in.The streets of Rome are unforgiving and harsh for a prostitute. There are\\nthose who sleep in caves and in the archways. Cabiria braggingly says, \"I\\'ve\\ngot my own house...here\\'s one girl who\\'s never slept under the arches. Well,\\nmaybe once.

       " u\"\\nI think there's just two reasons to make make this film the most\\nbeautiful thing I've ever seen on screen. I have yet to see a more\\nbeautiful movie. I'll explain below.The first is the play of emotions. At first Cabiria is upset after\\nfalling in the water. Then she smiles and laughs. Then she's upset.\\nThis transformation of emotions makes you throughout the movie want to\\nsee her smile. And when she laughs you're in heaven. With her. This is\\none reason: transformation of emotions, and your wish for Cabiria to\\nget to laugh.The second thing that moved me with all my emotions was her reaction to\\nsufferance. In her life she suffered before the movie (bad parents,\\nprostitution, social status, poverty), throughout the movie (although\\nher way of living rarely show you her sufferance in the movie, you feel\\nshe's very happy), and probably after the movie ends (again, bad future\\nmost likely). At the final part of the movie the pain is excruciating.\\nShe loses everything that connects her to the life (all her money &\\nhouse), love (lover), social status (marriage) and some hope (in life\\nand Virgin Mary). This is all in one scene. Actually, all she has left\\nare her friends and possibly a suitcase. And then it happens: she's\\nhappy. In the very final part her reaction is: she yells, while crying,\\nto the rubbing lover to kill her. She repeats this. And the final scene\\nis a victory on life. Sure, her life was, is (oh, boy, what must her\\nfeelings be right now) and will be filled with pain. But he takes this\\nreality, a certain fact, nothing's more concrete than this, and twists\\nit: she's happy. In a face of tears, after a horrifying painful\\nexperience, she looks at the unsuspecting people around her that are\\njoyful, happy, friendly, and takes their feeling: she smiles, almost\\nlaughing. There is no reality. The sufferance is beaten. Life has no\\nhard touch on her. This is much more than hope. She is not wishing for\\na better future. She's living it now. Life is transformed with her\\nfinal joy.I have yet to see a better movie. It's the one movie for which: I\\nregistered on IMDb, I voted, I read all the comments, I wrote this\\ncomment. No second place. My current top movies: this movie and below\\nthis everything else. There's not another movie I would recommend to\\nanyone older than 15.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\n`Le Notti di Cabiria', Federico Fellini's 1957 Academy Award winning film,\\nis a poignant, touching and timeless work of Italian cinema.  The film\\ndetails the life of Cabiria (played by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina), a\\n`night bird' who leads a cynical life of prostitution on the streets of\\nRome.  Throughout the film, Fellini guides us through her search for true\\nlove, refuge, and eventual salvation.  Her poetic story is one of sadness,\\nhope, and the unending search for a true place to call home.  Giulietta\\nMasina's brilliant performance draws her audience into her ravaged world and\\nleaves them forever changed.Cabiria has been a prostitute since her youngest days - she recollects\\nentering the streets at 15 with `long, dark hair', unaware of what she was\\ngetting into.  As we learn in the opening scene, she has been consistently\\ntaken advantage of by men, yet attempts to walk a fine line between clinging\\nto them in a search for true happiness and remaining ever independent and\\nself-sufficient.  As soon as the film opens, she is robbed by her pimp, and\\nlater spends the night with a self-consumed wealthy director.  However, the\\ndirector throws her in the closet as soon as his girlfriend arrives and in\\nthe morning quickly escorts a sad Cabiria out of the house, with all her\\nhopes crushed.  During the film Cabiria is frequently enticed by the promise\\nof a new life in her encounters, yet consistently meets impending doom.The most heartbreaking theme of the film is Cabiria's hopeless search for\\nhappiness and salvation.  We see that her friends in the business are no\\nbetter off - Cabiria's story is a universal account.  She is cynical and\\ncold only because of the tragedy she has suffered when she has chosen to\\nshare herself.  However, she makes a gradual transformation throughout the\\nfilm as soon as she meets D'onofrio - a handsome, intelligent and caring man\\nwho finds Cabiria at a comedy show.  Cabiria is at first doubtful and aloof\\naround him, but as the story progresses becomes more open and loving.  She\\nhas finally found the answer in D'onofrio; she proceeds to sell her house\\nand gather her life savings to live the married life as her mother had with\\nD'onofrio.  In the end of the film, her hopes are once again crushed as\\nFellini brings us to a cliff overlooking a river, the same setting as the\\nopening scene in which Cabiria was robbed by her pimp and thrown into the\\nriver.  Cabiria recognizes why D'onofrio has taken her there, breaks down\\ncrying and asks for him to throw her over the cliff.  D'onofrio takes her\\nlife savings and leaves her on the cliff to her sorrows.  Fellini ends the\\nfilm with a shot of Cabiria looking into the camera smiling through her\\ntears - she still has some hope for humanity inside her.It seems that no\\nmatter how desperate her struggles, Cabiria can not leave her life on the\\nstreets.  She tells D'onofrio that as a teenager she and her friend Wanda\\nhad tried to escape the streets through starting a newspaper stand and could\\nnever get it off the ground.  Perhaps it is something about Cabiria that\\nkeeps her working on the streets, perhaps it is her eternal hope in the\\ngoodness of mankind.  She will never stop believing someone good is waiting\\nfor her out in the obscurity of the night.  While at a holy site where Mary\\nwas to have appeared, she begs in tears for Mary to change her life.  Her\\nprayers, expectedly, are not answered.  In `Le Notti di Cabiria', Fellini\\nbreaks our hearts through Giulietta Masina's brilliant portrayal of an\\ninfinite search for love amongst a dark world ravaged with deceit and pain.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nMy friends went to see The Queen last night - I was too tired and\\ndecided to go back home. I put in the DVD and got into bed figuring I\\nwould watch an half hour or so and fall asleep. At the end of nearly 2\\nhours, I was sitting up straight, wide awake, awestruck at the genius\\nin the direction and acting. This is cinema at its finest. I have seen\\nLa Strada before and I now rank Fellini's earlier work as among my all\\ntime favorites (along with Ozu.) Masina's tearful smile at the camera\\nat the end is pure magic - so much dignity and hope captured in a\\nsingle second. Her performance throughout the movie was a revelation -\\nshe got innocent hope and graceful charm to shine through her\\nfoul-mouthed vulgar acting character. I simultaneously cared and\\ndespaired for her - this movie pulled me in like no recent Hollywood\\nmovie has for a long long time.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nLe Notti is a very rich,thematically, and diversified movie:the\\nfreshness and the concreteness,a strange inebriate detachment (in the\\n\"Alberto\" the movie star episode),men\\'s wickedness,the horrible\\nbaseness,the sordidness,the suavity,the gentleness and the\\nbitterness,the irreverence towards the Christianity,also themes from\\nprevious (Il Bidone,La Strada) and even future (La Dolce vita,Toby\\nDammit,the easy-going eccentric Roman inebriate night life,Rome\\'s night\\nlife) films.Fellini no longer believes in,or no longer practices the\\nShakespearian notes he used in Il Bidone,that kind of Shakespearean\\nintensity.Anyway,like \"Il Bidone\",\"Le Notti\" changes register in its\\nlast part,and offers that unsparing insight deeper than the reality\\nitself.Transitional movie,\"Le Notti\" is at once a recapitulation of\\nthemes from previous works,and a preparation for his future essays (the\\n4 great movies from the \\'60s).The epic texture is still important.I\\ndon\\'t think that Fellini ever bets on the \"social document\",etc.,and\\nhis ephemeral,or,at least,temporary association with some Neorealists\\nin the \\'50s is generally misunderstood and made to mean something it\\nnever was.A thin-skinned prostitute,\"Cabiria\",meets a bashful\\naccountant.Seen through Cabiria\\'s experiences,her tribulations,the\\nthings she sees, tell more about her own mind,she is not,as such,the\\ndirector\\'s representative,though Fellini depicts reproachfully the\\nmalice of some of those met by Cabiria in her way.The world as\\npresented in \"Le Notti ...\" is,at least partially,seen through the\\nprostitute\\'s eyes,hence the touch of grotesque and even some kind of a\\ntwisted naivet\\xe9,a la Sue.In this world seen by Cabiria,there are some\\nlandmarks of concrete humanity,e.g. the philanthropist met by the\\nprostitute,or the Friar.It is always surprising,but also heartening, to\\nsee a man of great intelligence needing to give goodness and humanity a\\nplace in his work.(Kusturica,who refused any resemblance with Fellini\\nand denied any influence,uses the same kind of endowing the sleazy\\nworlds he explores with at least one firm landmark of goodness,so this\\nworld it is not left to its own degeneration and cowardice.)I see in\\nthis lapidary insert that never patronizes the sign of a distinguished\\ndeftness.(In \"Il Bidone\" such a character misses.)Albeit mixed with\\nirony and sarcasm (those of an exceptional mind ),Fellini\\'s compassion\\nis none the less authentic.His relative neutrality,his neatness in\\nhanding this humble epic stuff do not make him an indifferent\\nwitness.(As a youngster,Fellini planned to make a movie about a \"little\\nwildflower of grace\", Serenella ;more interesting is to note that this\\n\"little wildflower of grace\" was,for Fellini,one of \"the two faces of\\nthe Church\".Fellini had opinions,had ideas about real\\nlife,goodness,etc..Fellini even had a very keen and salubrious idea\\nabout the true task of Christianity for man,to \"restore him to his\\ndivine greatness\".)He was also known to admire humility, simplicity,and\\nhe knew to be politically incorrect in this.\"Le Notti\" may be Fellini funniest movie:it abounds in comical\\nthings,and this comic is always tasteful and intelligent.It also has a\\ncertain quality that can be simply described as gentlemanly.Also,let us\\nnote that in \"Le Notti\" Fellini avoided the cruelty\\'s altitude reached\\nalready in \"Il Bidone\",but maintains a more comical and grotesque\\nregister.In \"Le Notti ...\" Fellini still has a narrative thread;he\\ngives shape to various intuitions,feelings, perceptions,dreams,in an\\nimpressionistic and fancy but well-conceived and finely molded way.His\\nenjoyment of the clownish aspects of the reality is a relish.Cabiria\\'s world is explored with Fellini\\'s appetite for the concrete.He\\nconnives with the prostitutes and the hussies,sends Cabiria in the\\nmedium of the rich,in that of the religious pilgrimages....There are\\nsome powerful vignettes,displaying Fellini\\'s gusto and skills for\\nseizing various facets of the social life.His mastership in depicting\\nrealist scenes that none the less have a bizarre and ambiguous twist is\\nobvious in Cabiria\\'s tribulations.With the air of making a purely\\nreflexive and intransitive work,Fellini still expresses freely,with an\\nUn-faked ingenuity, his thoughts about life,people,etc..While affecting\\nto leave outside his feelings and opinions about everyday life and the\\ncommon experience,Fellini none the less slipped his own thoughts and\\nreactions,because he did have them and was not sank into some kind of\\nimpassibility,placidity and indifference.Fellini\\'s ironic\\ndetachment,caustic sometimes,was,in his \\'50s movies,a good way to\\nperceive the reality and to depict it without being patronizing or\\nThesist.The man was very refined and subtle and he refused to be\\nencapsulated,enclosed,encompassed in an artistic formula;he believed in\\nthe richness and irreducible character of both life and art.This\\nplayful man wasn\\'t a joker.Fellini passed a judgment on certain aspects\\nof life,and resented the cruelty and the wickedness,without ever being\\ndidactic or moralist;but it must be said that,as director,he was both\\nvery intelligent and ironic,and ingenuous,natural,spontaneous;one,no\\nless than the other.He was as impassible and as ingenuous as his very\\nkeen intelligence made him to be.Nobody was farther than Fellini from\\nconforming himself to a theoretical model about how should man be and\\ncreate.I want to praise \"Cabiria\"\\'s actors\\' genuineness,beginning with Mrs.\\nMasina;this was her fifth movie with her husband.She was ever more than\\na \"Fellini actress\".Her ethereal and funny approach denotes a very\\nmature understanding.(But it is true that Fellini wanted for his movies\\nreal actors, great actors,not puppets,he favored the creative skills of\\nthe actors.) Fran\\xe7ois P\\xe9rier\\'s performance is simply gold;it has that\\nsensitivity,delicacy,nuances and fineness that are compelling.\"Cabiria\" is on the iridescent side of Fellini\\'s \\'50s career,the other\\nside being the \"realist\" and narrative one.This iridescent side is\\nirreducible to schools and trends,expressing Fellini\\'s refusal to use\\nthe standard methods and to work within a common code,and favoring,at\\nfirst through this poetry of the Faubourg,the experimental and a new\\nApprehensibility.It is important to notice that Fellini was a great\\nexperimenter,and one that never cogs;he is probably the most famed\\ncinema experimenter.( \"I have one great limitation\",said Fellini,\"not\\nhaving general ideas about anything\".)Fellini agreed,once,that \"all my films revolve around \" the \"love\\ntoward one\\'s neighbor\".Those who are used to receive this only in a\\nconventional,didactic way,won\\'t even recognize it in Fellini\\'s works.Averty did the best homage to Fellini,considering him one of the three\\ndirectors that never made a bad movie,and unable to make one.I\\nsubscribe.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI love Federico Fellini, but I dread his early works like La Strada\\nbecause they are so sad. Poor Giulietta Masina, one of the greatest\\nfilm actresses of all time, she always gets the short end of the stick\\nand because the movie magic is so intense, our heart breaks right along\\nwith her.Fellini is the Great Director Italian style. I don't mean he isn't the\\ngreatest director, better than Hitchcock, Welles, a modern like\\nScorcese. I'm looking at his work, have seen most of them, and I can't\\nmake up my mind. He might be the greatest that ever lived. His films in\\nblack and white, the Neo-Realism of Italian film after the war, the\\nincredible original vision, the writing, and directing, it's as though\\nMichelangelo came back as a director.Masina is a prostitute, but her loves turn out to be pocketbook\\ngrabbers. Her physical well being is not high on her boyfriend's\\npriority list. She's such a little women, frail, and in Nights she\\nplays a tough, brawling, whimsical, and hopeless romantic. Her acting\\nstyle is over the top, almost carnival character as she had played it\\nin La Strada, but as Cabiria, she's older, but not necessarily wiser.\\nThe final revelation with French actor Fran\\xe7ois P\\xe9rier is so heart\\nrendering because after an hour and a half of Cabiria's, laughter,\\ntrials, and disappointments, we identify with her completely.

Nights of Cabiria is not a chick flick,this movie has an insight ,the\\ncharacter study of a misfortune women.Just like a mirror,this movie\\nshows us the reality of life,true depiction of the cruel and\\nunaffectionate world we live in but still inspires us.Sometimes,I wonder how can i relate myself so much with a movie that is\\nnot even near around to my culture,language,era and the country.Nights\\nof Cabiria is one of those movies.this movie was made in 1957(the year\\neven when my parents were not born) and from the country of Italy,i\\nhardly know anything about it's culture and language.But still love the\\nmovies from Italy,the country where one of the most beautiful movies of\\nthe world are made.It is because of that these movies have boundless\\nemotions that flows beyond the border of any country,passes all the\\nhurdles of language and time and equally capable to penetrate the\\nemotions of audience,irrespective of it's language and country.The movies like Nights of Cabiria are like Diamond which have no\\ninfluence of time,only they get more and more beautiful as the time\\npasses.The world will never forget the cinematic gems like this.\\n\",\n",

However, \"Sweet Charity\" being one of my favorite musicals when\\nit appeared on Sundance one Saturday night, I couldn\\'t resist.  And I\\'m glad\\nI didn\\'t.  Frederico Fellini is a skillful and masterful man.  His direction\\nis absolutely AWESOME, to say the least.  And words cannot describe the\\nglorious performance of his wife, Giulietta Masina.  Fellini did for Masina\\nwhat Bob Fosse did for his wife, Gwen Verdon on the stage when it was\\ntransposed to \"Sweet Charity.\"  Masina is so believable and so real... with\\nthat street-urchin appearance, those huge, sparkling eyes, that wistful\\nsmile, and her petite figure... she is absolute perfection in the role of\\nCabiria.  This is one film that is a MUST SEE... and if you\\'ve already seen\\nit, SEE IT AGAIN.  Two thumbs up!!!!\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI have seen these film many times and still feel the thrill of contact\\nwith\\nREAL CINEMA. \"Cabiria\" is perfect as it can be. If this were the only film\\nof Fellini it would be enough to prove that he was a genius.Masina is simply unforgettable, and it is such a pity that such films and\\nsuch actors do not exist  anymore.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nIn a way \"Nights of Cabiria\" is the companion piece to \"La Strada\",\\nboth directed by Federico Fellini, both starring his wife and muse\\nGiulietta Masina and both dealing with a woman and her struggle with\\nlife. And yet the movies conclude quite differently. Cabiria is one of\\nthose characters that really get under your skin in the progression of\\nthe film - it\\'s a woman who seems difficult to understand at the\\nbeginning when she\\'s saved from drowning, yet doesn\\'t even have a word\\nof thanks for her saviours and heads off ranting. What follows is grand\\ncharacter development. Episode by episode we get deeper in Cabiria\\'s\\nheart and mind, her hopes and dreams, see her praying for a miracle,\\nbut again and again she fails, is used, ridiculed, ignored. Cabiria is\\nnot just a naive girl stumbling into her doom, she rather seeks\\nsalvation in simplicity and belief when everything else shatters to\\npieces. She\\'s actually quite a complex character - emotional, earthy\\nand proud in her own way, yet vulnerable and always on the brink. And\\nwe are swept away with her when eventually that turn in her fate is\\nactually happening, the change for which we\\'ve all been rooting by\\nthen.It all leads up to one of the most striking final scenes in cinema\\nhistory - Fellini\\'s camera work and Masina\\'s performance invoke pure\\nmovie magic: Never before is a greeting from a total stranger as\\nheart-warming as here, never again will a well-timed nod into the\\ncamera be so electrifying as Cabiria\\'s. Maybe you already know what I\\nmean. In any case I conclude with: Buona sera!\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nNights of Cabiria is one of those timeless old films that will always remain\\npoignant and relevant.  It carries that old innocent cinematic charm of an\\nera that can never be duplicated.Masina, is so talented in this film and this character is SO unforgettable. \\nWHAT TALENT!!  This woman doesn't even have to say anything!!  You just have\\nto look into those huge pupils and watch the variety of expressions on her\\nface that convey so many emotions without a single word.  I would but it in\\ncomparisons to Masina as a circus clown, who can just do everything with her\\nface.The film is a good play on life and redemption in general (done very well\\nmight I add), and for that it rates high for me personally.  It is also very\\nfunny and charming.  I can not comment on how it compares to Sweet Charity\\n(which is based on this film) cause I have not seen it.The film slows in certain sections but is never boring.  GREAT\\nFILM!!Rating 8 out of 10\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n...alongside La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2 and Amarcord. Fellini's films are not\\nfor everybody perhaps, but I admire them how well made made and\\ndirected they are, some of them like Amarcord and the peacock in the\\nsnow have breathtakingly beautiful images that stay long in the mind,\\nfor his choices in composers and actors, for his deliberately paced and\\nsometimes ambitious stories(8 1/2 is especially true of this) and also\\nthat the characters are not always what they seem at first glance.\\nNights of Cabiria I have seen before criticised as grating, sentimental\\nand self-indulgent(the latter being a criticism of Fellini's films in\\ngeneral and him also actually), and while I am understanding, I\\npersonally don't agree.I find Nights of Cabiria to be one of his accessible films, and along\\nwith La Strada also his most moving. Again it is incredibly well made,\\nwith beautiful scenery and cinematography. The images are again very\\nmemorable, and done with much emotional resonance, the best of which\\nbeing the ending which is both tragic and uplifting. Fellini's\\ndirection is superb, the personal nostalgia that is apparent in all his\\nfilms is here and you do identify with the story and the titular\\ncharacter. The music has much beauty and nostalgic charm, while the\\nstory perfectly tells of the sheer happiness and then tearful sorrow of\\nunfortunate Cabiria's life. Cabiria, the titular character, is one you\\ncan identify with immediately, feeling pity and also her conflicting\\nemotions as she tries to remain positive even in the face of adversity.\\nGiulietta Masina gives a bravura performance, her face and eyes are\\nbeautifully expressive and she is just heart-breaking. Francois Perier\\nalso shines as the stranger who makes the offer that is almost too good\\nto be true.Overall, a truly beautiful film and one of Fellini's best, certainly\\none of my favourites as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nLike Maria Falconetti in \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\", Meryl Streep in\\n\"Sophie\\'s Choice\" or Gena Rowlands in \"A Woman Under the Influence\",\\nGuiletta Masina in \"Nights of Cabiria\" displayed, with a poignant\\nauthenticity, the courage to overcome the adversity underlining her\\nvulnerable condition.Coincidentally, like Gena Rowlands with John Cassavettes, Masina was\\ndirected by her husband, Federico Fellini. And I believe this is the\\nkey of intimacy that liberates the actress in front of the camera and\\nallows her to express every single emotion with intensity, and no fear\\nof being over-the-top, the man behind the camera takes care of\\neverything. And \"Intense\" to describe Guiletta Masina\\'s performance is\\nan understatement, so is the very word \"performance\". Masina lives\\nCabiria, with an endearing generosity and universal appeal. Rarely have\\nI felt so much empathy toward a character who happens to be a\\nloud-mouth thirty something prostitute.Cabiria is introduced as a joyful woman living a passionate romance\\nwith Giorgio, she kisses him, embraces him, then he suddenly steals her\\npurse and pushes her into the river, where she nearly drowns before\\nbeing saved by a group of young men. The opening scene is intriguing by\\nits setting, an industrial area far away from the city, and the broad\\ndaylight, and its cheerful tone followed by a tragic twist, then an\\noptimistic resolution. Basically, after a first viewing, you simply\\nrealize how the first minutes, in their tragicomic aspect; represent\\nthe movie in microcosm. But the emotional trap not to fall in is to\\nconsider Cabiria as a pathetic woman on which bad luck keep going on,\\nFellini\\'s film is the chronicles of a series of misfortunes punctuated\\nwith optimistic statements about human nature, and it\\'s up to the\\nviewer, to Cabiria, to see the half-filled or half-empty glass.Cabiria\\'s surprisingly ungrateful reaction after she\\'s rescued is\\nanother indication of her unique temperament. She trusts any bad\\nintentioned smooth-talking Don Juan over any genuinely caring person.\\nIn the following scene, her best friend Wanda seems very concerned and\\nfriendly before being harshly dismissed. Cabiria has the sweetness and\\nthe temper of a child, and her tragedy is that she never displays the\\nright reactions at the right time, making the general mood of the film\\nfascinatingly unpredictable. Cabiria never misses an occasion to dance,\\nwith her unique charisma; she steals the show and creates an eccentric\\ncheerful mood even inside the prostitute\\'s circle. Her positive\\nattitude is a personal way to rise herself above her condition. As she\\nlikes to remind everyone: she owns her house. She has an almost\\nchildish way to brag about the fact that she\\'s not like any prostitute.\\nIndeed, we never see her in activity, she embodies the condition of\\nbeing a prostitute, disdained, insulted, taken advantage of, and her\\neternal suspicious attitude toward any sign of kindness is an\\nunfortunate professional bias. Both tragic and comic, Cabiria reminded\\nme of two classic movies notorious for having inspired Fellini.Cabiria\\'s appearance is almost comical, she\\'s short but doesn\\'t\\nembarrass herself with high heels, instead she has these white socks\\nworn with very unlikely sandals, and eyebrows a la Mickey Mouse. During\\nthe Mambo part, every eyes stare at her. She dances and moves a bit\\nlike Chaplin in \"Modern Times\", Cabiria is a sort of female clown with\\nthe right mix of pathos and burlesque, the Tramp with the umbrella as\\ncane-like accessory. And when she gets in the beautiful house of the\\nrich movie star, and he starts developing a fondness on her, we expect\\na disillusion to come, like the Tramp with the Rich Man in \"City\\nlights\". Mickey Mouse or Charlie Chaplin, Cabiria is the female\\nincarnation of the universally appealing figure of \"little fellow who\\ndoes his best\" in a quite hostile world. The music of Nino Rota\\nembodies the playful mood of Cabiria\\'s misadventures until the sense of\\nurgency in her quest of a new life started to remind of another\\nmasterpiece: De Sica\\'s \"Bicycle Thieves\". Like the new bicycle changed\\nRicci\\'s life, a new love would transform Cabiria, and the desperation\\ngrowing deeper and stronger as indicated in that scene where she joins\\nthe pilgrims and asks the Virgin Mary to change her life, was a\\npowerful reminiscence of Ricci visiting the Wise Woman.This is the dilemma that inhabits \"Nights of Cabiria\", romantic or\\nrealistic. When after having been so mistreated during a magic show\\nCabiria was approached by the kind accountant Oscar, played by Fran\\xe7ois\\nP\\xe9rier, I wanted her to keep her guard up. And as he seemed genuinely\\nin love, convincing her after several meetings, to marry him, and leave\\neverything for him, my heart pounded as I was expecting the worst to\\nhappen. And then came the climactic scene in the cliff when Cabiria\\nunderstood Oscar\\'s dark motives, just like Giorgio\\'s, and she started\\nsobbing, my heart literally melted. Cabiria is the quintessential\\nromantic person, in the denial of the world\\'s reality, and the pain in\\nher heart, was her realization that the vision she always tries to\\nreject was true. But she pulled herself together, started walking when\\na group of happy young people dancing and playing music formed a\\ncheerful parade around her. This was the \"City Lights\"-like ending the\\nmovie needed: the ultimate triumph of the faith in human spirit.\\nCabiria is like reborn in this scene, her eyebrows are natural, her\\nsmile genuine, her wounds healed, as she feels in security again, hence\\nher quick glance at Fellini, behind the camera, or was she simply\\nthanking us, viewers, for loving her?Kabir\\' means \\'big\\' or \\'powerful\\' in Arabic, and I wouldn\\'t be\\nsurprised, if the name was a derivation from that Semitic epithet.\\nCabiria is a character defined by a personality that transcends the\\nlimits of her tiny little body. Size-wise, she\\'s everything but\\nCabiria, street-wise, she has one hell of a big mouth and as a human\\nbeing, her heart is simply gigantic \\x85\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThis is the first Fellini film I ever saw (and thank heavens I saw it on\\nthe\\nbig screen); I absolutely FELL IN LOVE with its now-legendary star\\nGiulietta\\nMasina (in the title role of Cabiria).  Watching the movie, I wanted to\\nshout to her to \"watch out!\" and to jump into the screen to take her away\\nfrom the parasites who wanted to feed on her.  So entranced was I by\\nMasina\\'s performance.  Telling the surface plot is unnecessary here; the\\nfilm\\'s substance happens between the lines: Cabiria\\'s emotional depth\\nbetween the devastations, her perpetual longing for better and, despite it\\nall, her indomitable happiness.  It\\'s the story of predators and prey\\n(Cabiria), and it\\'s a picture of the enduring human spirit. Only an actress\\nof transcendent powers could pull off such a task, and Masina manages it\\nbeautifully.  Look at the IMDb \"Awards & Nominations\" page for this film:\\nin 1957 Masina won \"Best Actress\" at Cannes; in 1958 the film won the Oscar\\nfor \"Best Foreign Language Film;\" and in 1959 the film was nominated for a\\nBritish Academy Award for \"Best Film From Any Source.\"  Three of the film\\'s\\nmagical moments:  1) the \"Hypnotist\" scene.   2) After falling asleep atop\\na\\ncliff where one of those \"predators\" had taken advantage of her, she awakes\\nand the sea below this cliff is now covered by a misty shroud (you\\ninterpret\\nwhat \"being above the clouds\" means).  And 3) after a final personal\\ndevastation, she joins a small troupe of carefree youth in their singing\\nand\\ndancing as they walk the road.  Joining them, her dirt-smudged and\\ntear-swollen face regains its radiance and we feel happy that she\\'s smiling\\nagain.  But the real brilliance of this moment - one of the most affecting\\nin all cinema - is when Cabiria glances briefly INTO THE LENS, smiles and\\nnods AT *US* that she will be alright.  Watching this movie that first time\\nI was happy that she was smiling among these young troubadours, but not\\nuntil she glanced, smiled and nodded directly TO ME did I feel released\\nfrom\\nmy need to rescue and protect her, free to leave the theater and let her go\\non her own (without me).  Personally, no other actress has ever been able\\nto\\npenetrate so completely to my emotional core. Brilliant director, brilliant\\nactress.  SEE THIS MOVIE.  \\n',\n",
       " u'\\nMs. Masina (Mrs. Fellini), is simply one of the most superlative\\nactresses in history. Yes, we all know the infidelities and troubles\\nMr. and Mrs. Fellini had in their life-long marriage. Like every other\\nmarriage we know.What is astonishing are the artistic treasures they left us.\"Nights of Cabiria\" is one among many of the finest films ever made.\"Sweet Charity,\" the musical rip-off of this masterpiece, cheapens the\\nentire enterprise. Good intentions notwithstanding.We don\\'t need Bob Fosse, and certainly not Shirley MacClaine replacing\\nGiulietta Masina, nor second-rate Cy Coleman\\'s score, to \"musicalize\"\\nwhat was already a brilliant musical (thanks to Nino Rota and\\nBonagura).Fellini\\'s film \"sings\" on its own, thank you.\"Sweet Charity\" is a perfect example of Hollywood and Broadway making a\\ntravesty of art.\"Sweet Charity\" -- film and stage performances -- are hollow, shallow\\nexercises compared to the original film. Yeah, Shirley and Chita Rivera\\nand Paula Kelly dance up a storm. Nothing to do with the story or the\\ncharacters. Everything to do with making a \"musical.\" What fun!\\nUnfortunately, Broadway and Hollywood cut out the heart. Dancing\\nzombies.Fellini\\'s film is the gem. Polished to within an inch of its life,\\nthough pretending to be a diamond in the rough. Like all Fellini\\'s\\nworks.Giulietta Masina IS the tiny hooker you want to love. No Hollywood\\n\"star\" \"playing\" a hooker: she simply is. Like all (few) great\\nactresses.Fellini knows what he has, in a wife, in an actress. He\\'s genius enough\\nto turn the camera on her and let her genius shine.Don\\'t think she\\'s a genius? Try \"La Strada.\" \"Juliet of the Spirits.\"\\n\"Ginger and Fred.\" Or her non-Fellini-directed turn in \"Madwoman of\\nChaillot\" with Katherine Hepburn.Giulietta Masina is as gifted a cinema actress as there ever was.Federico Fellini is as gifted a cinema director as there ever was.Marriages between geniuses are rare.Fellini is without peer.Give the actress, and her director husband, their due.Cinema has never seen their likes before or since.Fellini and Masina.

       " u\"\\nI saw this movie for the first time last night, and I have to post my\\nfirst review on the site to say it is really wonderful. Giulietta\\nMasina's performance is truly one of the most impressive I've ever seen\\n- her face is as expressive as Buster Keaton's or Charlie Chaplin's.The movie is a deceptively simple story about the day-to-day encounters\\nof a prostitute who does the best she can to make a living and maintain\\nher hopes and dreams of a better life. Her relationships with her\\nneighbors, friends, and street-corner associates are a major focus, as\\nare her relationships with the many men that come and go in her life.\\nIn the latter regard, it is obvious that this film was the inspiration\\nfor many other plays and films, including Sweet Charity. The series of people encountered by Cabiria in the movie shows us the\\nfull range of human reaction to life's adversity - some respond with\\ncynicism and prey on others without remorse, some respond with\\ngenerosity and hope, some respond by clinging to certain belief systems\\nthat don't really help them in a material way, etc. Cabiria definitely\\nstands out as a unique character within the gritty, grimy community of\\npost-war Rome, where there are stark differences between people of\\ndifferent classes and livelihoods. We can see that she is a good person\\nliving in a world that is not always humane or fair.I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it took a lot of\\ncreativity and inspiration to include the ending of this movie as it is\\n- I'm sure it was as startling and unexpected to audiences in 1957 as\\nit is emotionally moving still today.The direction, photography, and acting are all first-rate in this\\nclassic. Everybody involved was obviously engaged in a labor of love. I\\ncannot recommend it more highly.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis is being a very typical Fellini movie, with a Fellini style and\\nlook to it as well as some of the typical characters and story\\ndevelopments. And I must say that this is probably one of my favorite\\nFellini movies! As basically all Fellini movies, it has a very simple concept and an\\nextremely straightforward storyline. It\\'s simply following its main\\ncharacter around, who is in search of love and happiness. The story is\\ngetting told almost like an adventure movie, as the main character\\nvisits lots of different places and is meeting a wide variety of\\ncharacters. The movie is foremost a drama but it also has a strange\\ncomedy tone to it, making this still a very entertaining movie to watch\\nas well.The message you can take from it is that you shouldn\\'t desperately\\nsearch for happiness and then expect to end up getting more happy than\\nyou were before. That\\'s a lesson the main character in this movie\\nlearns the hard way. But luckily it really isn\\'t a movie that is being\\npreachy in any way. It never tries too hard to get its message across\\nor to try to get any emotions out of you. It\\'s a far too subtle and\\nsuperiorly made movie for that.Most credit of course needs to go to Federico Fellini, who does a\\nwonderful job with the storytelling. But the cinematography also is an\\nimportant aspect. The movie has some very dynamic camera-work in it,\\nthat makes the movie a very lively and warm one, even thought its shot\\nin \\'cold\\' black & white.But just as much credit needs to got to Mrs. Fellini, or rather said\\nGiulietta Masina, who plays the lead role. She goes through some\\namazing transitions throughout this movie and she was an actress that\\ncould act just as well with just only her eyes and facial expressions.\\nTruly a wonderful performance and all a real pleasure to watch. It\\'s\\nprobably even a better performance than the one in the other Fellini\\nmovie \"La strada\", which was also a movie that I just loved.Simply storytelling and film-making at its very best!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\\n',\n",

The person who falls in love with\\nCabiria is you sitting in the audience. In the audience, we share a\\nnumber of intimate moments with Cabiria like when she is alone in the\\nmovie star's bathroom, and when she is praying to the Madonna for a\\nbetter life, and when she is preparing hopefully for her marriage. No\\ncharacter in the film ever gets to know her as intimately as we do.In the film's denouement, she is sort of walking off into the future\\nwith us as her adoring audience.

       " u\"\\nLike some others mentioned before: this film is like a good wine. It\\ncomes with age.

I would\\ndescribe it differently, although the comparison with wine will still\\nbe relevant. The thing that makes this film great, in my opinion, is\\nits 'aftertaste' . While I was watching the film, I was stunned by the\\nacting of Masina, yet not in another way then with 'La Strada'. When\\nthe film ended I was very impressed, yet not as much as when I saw\\n'Otto e Mezzo'. The thing is, I'm finally realising how much I loved\\nthis film, while I'm writing this. Maybe the acting wasn't superior to\\n'La Strada's' acting. I actually liked the rest of the cast better in\\n'La Strada' (which included Quinn and Basehart besides Masina). Nor was\\nthe film as challenging and sophisticated as 'Otto e Mezzo'. But 'La\\nStrada' didn't have a story like 'Le Notti di Cabiria' and a divine\\ncharacter like Cabiria. And 'Otto e Mezzo' didn't have Masina in it.\\nThat's what makes 'Le Notti di Cabiria' as memorable as it is. And\\nbecause of that, this film can be called Fellini's true masterpiece\\nand, by saying that, one of the best films ever made.\\n\",\n",

Very oddly constructed scenes at time and the B&W really\\nsets the tone for this odd tale of prostition. Lots of symbolism about\\nreligion and class in 1940's Italy.Fellini is a true master.

Never too many cuts of C-U shots either, which i\\nlike.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThe world of Federico Fellini was ,is and will be holding us captives\\nas long as Cinema as Art exists. \"The Nights Of Cabiria\" is no\\nexception.Though chronologically it belongs to the 50ies of the 20th\\ncentury ,it is a strong message to us all, to our children, to those\\nwho will come after:hope against hope;never give up;the darkest moments\\nin life will pass, blind and irrational (as it seems)belief in human\\ngoodness always prevails, whereas blind religious fervor always fails (\\nwe should not forget that Fellini had always been critical of the\\nCatholic Church). Julietta Masina is a superb actress who had actually\\nsacrificed her might-have-been outstanding career(in fact, what she had\\naccomplished is remarkable,but she could have done much much more as an\\nactress) for the sake of her husband, and that makes her even greater\\nas a human being.Of course, her \"smile through tears\" is unforgettable.\\nNino Rota\\'s music does not just add to ,but co-creates the atmosphere\\nof the film , the rarest case, when two genii(Rota and Fellini)found\\neach other as wonderful partners-in-art, never trying to overshadow\\neach other. I teach a course in European Cinema at a university in\\nTaiwan, and I always show my Chinese students \"The Nights of\\nCabiria\".Their reaction and feedback are amazing:they FEEL the\\ncharacters of different time and culture with an amazing intensity.It\\njust proves once again that true ART has no boundaries.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThis is my favorite film of all time.\"Cabiria\" is why Fellini is hailed as one of the world\\'s great\\nartists.Back then he had that rare gift for crafting--heck, channeling--no nonsense\\nstories whose import is at the once unflinchingly mythical and trenchantly\\npractical in its examination of what it is to be a part-ape/part-angel\\nhuman.  All that, and he could do the million-and-one other things necessary\\nto create what is, after all, a treasured objet d\\'art that speaks to the\\nmasses about what is universal and important; true love.  And it does all\\nthis absent a cop-out \"feel good\" ending!I\\'m so thankful for the recent restoration and DVD, including the\\nreinsertion of the \"man with the sack\" scene.  I was particularly thankful\\nfor De Laurentiis\\'s angle on the story of the original excising of that\\nsegment.  It only serves to impress upon us that Fellini was in no wise\\nkidding when he characterized himself as a professional prevaricator.  Amen\\nto that!  And see this movie!  The greatest bittersweet lie ever told, with\\nthe power to change the way you see yourself and others.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nBefore viewing \"The Nights of Cabiria\", I had never seen a foreign film\\n(yes, I know, it\\'s a shame... but then again, most fifteen year olds\\nhaven\\'t).  However, \"Sweet Charity\" being one of my favorite musicals when\\nit appeared on Sundance one Saturday night, I couldn\\'t resist.  And I\\'m glad\\nI didn\\'t.  Frederico Fellini is a skillful and masterful man.  His direction\\nis absolutely AWESOME, to say the least.  And words cannot describe the\\nglorious performance of his wife, Giulietta Masina.  Fellini did for Masina\\nwhat Bob Fosse did for his wife, Gwen Verdon on the stage when it was\\ntransposed to \"Sweet Charity.\"  Masina is so believable and so real... with\\nthat street-urchin appearance, those huge, sparkling eyes, that wistful\\nsmile, and her petite figure... she is absolute perfection in the role of\\nCabiria.  This is one film that is a MUST SEE... and if you\\'ve already seen\\nit, SEE IT AGAIN.  Two thumbs up!!!!\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n...and, for me, one of the great acting jobs in the history of\\nfilm. I know,\\nI know, that sounds like hyperbole, but Masina's face is a miracle here,\\nable to project any emotion with a twitch of the lips, a waggle of the\\neyebrows. Oh, why am I writing about it? You need to see this movie, and\\nif\\nyou've already seen it, you need to see it again.\\n\\n\",\n",

And it is this smile that makes us love and\\nsympathize with Cabiria - a delicate and awkward child who has to overcome\\nherself to earn her hard living. But she is the one who has guts: robbed\\nand\\nbetrayed, deceived and disillusioned, she is never beaten; she goes on\\nliving, no matter how hard it might be.Although filmed in 1957, \"Nights of Cabiria\" is still exciting and\\nrevealing, since it touches the inmost human feelings and depicts true\\nhuman\\ncharacters.\\n\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nIt would be far too simplistic to feel that the film merely presents an\\noptimist\\'s commitment to live and enjoy life in an imperfect world.\\n\"Nights of Cabiria\" has always intrigued me among the many Fellini\\nfilms that I have seen\\x97-it is great cinema that asks more questions\\nthan it provides answers.Question one\\x97who is the altruist who provides alms in the night to the\\nwretched of the earth? The only reason for the addition of this\\ncharacter seems to be that Fellini wants a contrasting figure who works\\nin the night\\x97one who gives sustenance to others in a commendable way\\x97a\\nway Cabiria would have preferred to live her life if she had an option.\\nIt was amusing for me to find out that this entire sequence was deleted\\nin earlier released versions of the film. My guess is that this\\nsequence was an addition of screenplay writer Pasolini, as it would fit\\ninto his style of Christian Marxism, more than the neorealism of\\nFellini. Interestingly, this is one of the three males in the film\\n(others being the actor who invites Cabiria home, and Brother Giovanni)\\nwho seem to have a pure heart and good intentions\\x97all the others seem\\nto have a predominant evil streak.Question two\\x97-Brother Giovanni leaves a profound effect on Cabiria.\\nConfessing to him (she thinks he is a full fledged priest) and having\\nMass celebrated by him was Cabiria\\'s wish but the cold response she\\nreceives from Giovanni\\'s colleague, who is apparently a full-fledged\\npriest, seems to be Fellini\\'s/Pasolini\\'s comment on the\\nChurch\\x97otherwise why have the scene? Question three-\\x97Cabiria\\'s eyebrows change their shape as she\\ncontemplates a married life. This is not in line with Fellini\\'s\\nCabiria, who would think about the effect eyebrows will make as she\\nswitches gears in her personal life. Or is Fellini suggesting that as\\nCabiria steps on the threshold of marriage, the personality of Cabiria\\nchanges to a more calculating woman, in contract to the earlier simple,\\nwaif like personality.Apart from questions such as these, it is unquestionably one of\\nFellini\\'s finest films. I preferred \"La Strada,\" another Fellini film\\nwith his wife Guilietta Massina in the lead role, and his later less\\ntalked about \"Orchestra Rehearsal,\" made some 20 years later, in which\\nsocial commentary takes center stage and storyline the backstage.I am surprised that most Fellini viewers are taken up with performances\\nand the story each Fellini film offers. The more poignant world of\\nFellini revolves around the commentary on the divide between the rich\\nand the poor, the honest and the dishonest, the religious and the\\nagnostic. The allure of Fellini to me remains his social commentary\\x97-he\\nunderlines this with Cabiria, in the final shot looking at you the\\nviewer, bringing up the nexus between the character and the viewer. In\\nfact, this final shot ought to wake up the sensibilities of the\\nlaid-back cinema viewer.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nFederico Fellini's Masterpiece Le notti di Cabiria is about a young\\nwoman's odyssey,who is by the way a prostitute,throughout Rome.During\\nthis odd adventures she comes face to face with her dreams but she\\nnever accomplishes them.She in a nostalgic climate looks back when she\\nwas younger and more innocent.She is a human being who admires people\\nwho give love and are selflessness.In the end she gets charmed from one\\npeople like those and in her kindness she believe's him but him tragic\\nconclusions.The trust that she shows to people throughout the film is\\nthe reason she gets deluded,but those characteristics make her,even she\\ndoesn't realize it one of those people she admires.The ending although\\nit seems sad in total,the last taste that the audience takes is the\\nview of a fighter,a human that looks everyone in the eyes and doesn't\\nfear to show feelings to anyone.The movie might seem boring to some people but when they'll reach to\\nthe ending they will be remunerated.The ending climax and the landscape of one of the most dramatic scenes\\nin cinema is outstanding.The viewer draws away from the happy turn the\\nmovie has gotten and is thrown for another time to cruelty of the\\nworld,but for another time people have to turn their backs to\\nheartbreak and death and fight again.The viewer suffers with the\\ncharacter in a silent scene where both the actress and the director\\nprove their talents.Summing up the movie is totally worth watching.Having a clear mind\\nwhile watching it will help to get all the meanings many of which have\\nescaped this review.Highlight of the film:The Ending.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nFrom director Federico Fellini (Amarcord), this is another film, in the\\nItalian language, that I found inside the pages of the book 1001 Movies\\nYou Must See Before You Die, it is one I liked the sound of as well.\\nBasically Maria 'Cabiria' Ceccarelli (BAFTA nominated Giulietta Masina)\\nis the wide-eyed street walking prostitute with not many friends but a\\nseemingly good outlook on life, and despite living on the poor end of\\nRome she does have a small house, a bank account and her dreams to keep\\nher going. The story follows Cabiria through a few nights (and days)\\nspending time with various men who have the same thing in common, they\\nall treat her rotten and disappear very quickly. These mistreating men\\ninclude a man who steals 40,000 lire and almost drowns her with her\\ninability to swim, a movie star who pays little attention to her, and a\\nman of god giving to the poor but again not drawing to her in any way.\\nAll Cabiria can do is spend a little time with her friend Wanda (Franca\\nMarzi), and religious services to pray to the holy one in order to have\\nher dream of a better life come true, including finding a man who truly\\nloves her. After helping an illusionist/hypnotist act on stage she\\nmeets accountant Oscar D'Onofrio (Fran\\xe7ois P\\xe9rier) who seems genuinely\\nkind and as they get to know each other liking the idea of a future\\ntogether, at first she is cautious and suspicious, but she does fall in\\nlove with him. They marry within only a few weeks, and during their\\nhoneymoon they spend time walking through the woods and towards a cliff\\noverlooking the lake, and Oscar becomes very suspicious indeed. Cabiria\\nrealises he intends to push her off the cliff and steal her money, so\\nshe just gives up her purse and lets him get away, but walking down the\\nlong road back home she can only smile through her tears in a parade of\\npeople, she must be hopeful that things will be alright. Also starring\\nAmedeo Nazzari as Alberto Lazzari, Aldo Silvani as The Wizard, Dorian\\nGray as Jessy, Ennio Girolami as Amleto, Mario Passante as Uncle of\\nAmleto and Pina Gualandri as Matilda the prostitute. In the leading\\nrole Masina, also Fellini's wife at the time, is wonderful with her\\nquirky facial expressions, venerability and child like attitude, she is\\npretty much the key to why this film is so watchable, the character\\nhaving all these misusing men are the most interesting scenes, it is a\\nthought provoking and enjoyable masterpiece, a great drama. It won the\\nOscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated the BAFTA\\nfor Best Film from any Source. Very good!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is my first comment on a movie so be nice, thanks. It is hard to\\ndescribe exactly what I felt during this movie but I was really moved.\\nDirected beautifully by Fellini casting his beautiful wife as the star.\\nShe has the most amazing smile and wonderful facial expressions. I\\nloved Oscar, he seemed to be just like me, except for the ending. He\\nacted out his love with passion and even deceived me, a little\\ntearjerker. My favorite part was when Cabiria encountered the\\nmagician/hypnotist. He gave such thought to his words and had such\\npoise and was a great entertainer, reminding me kind of like Edward\\nNorton in the illusionist. Oscar then took me away with his beautiful\\nwords. The first couple lines are his best. I love how at the end she\\nis torn and sad walking down the street with all the kids playing music\\nand dancing ironically next to her. She uses that to cheer herself up\\nwhich brings that great loving smile of hers to show us that she is\\nstill living and the worst is hopefully over, this gives us hope! I\\nlove how everyone keeps calling her a nut yet she still tries showing\\neverybody that she isn't what they think, even though it's not what\\nother people think of you that matters but what you think of yourself.\\nShowing other people just helps bring it out and who wouldn't want to\\nshow other people how you have changed for the better. Everyone is in\\nsearch for happiness but happiness lies within. Many people don't know\\nthat but it's how you think of things that brings happiness. A mind is\\na great thing. I would definitely watch this movies more times to come\\nand hope to get it on DVD. This is an art masterpiece. I've heard much\\nabout Fellini, and this was my first movie of him I've seen. He greatly\\ninfluenced David Lynch, my favorite director and one of the best artsy\\nmovie directors, as well as Stanley Kubrick. I look forward to seeing 8\\n1/2 which could be more comparable with Lynchian works. PS The only\\nreason that I give it an 8 and not 10 is because I want to leave room\\nfor improvement which there always is.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nThis is the very first time I see an Italian movie, and I loved it!\\nThis was very adorable movie. It was a nice journey, that I am glad I\\ntook. The movie was produced in 1957, set in the beautiful city of Rome\\nand directed and co-written by Frederico Fellini.The story of the movie is about a pretty crazy prostitute who we join\\nin her journey of life, she looks for love and salvation. It\\'s funny\\nand true. She is an optimist who sings, dances and swears a lot.The idea is really nice, I don\\'t know how often was a prostitute\\'s\\nstory shown in a movie in the 1950\\'s, but it\\'s defiantly an interesting\\nidea. Let\\'s see what I loved, I loved how open minded and independent\\nwas Cabiria (main character) in the movie, she owned her own house and\\nwas so proud of it. She wasn\\'t looking for marriage as much as love.She\\nwanted to change her life and didn\\'t accept just how things were.I also\\nenjoyed how although she went to church and asked for grace from virgin\\nMary, nothing changed in her life, because she kept it as it.I thought the directing was very good, it kept me interested and\\nenjoying the movie. I loved the scenery and acting of all actors. It\\nwas fun, lots of fun, even the soundtrack is fun, please listen to itMy favorite scene involved Cabiria hypnotized and revealing here true\\ninnocence in front of many people on stage.I still had few comments that I didn\\'t like, when she met a father in\\nthe church, he told her you must get married, it\\'s women\\'s duty to have\\nchildren and be wives, that was a little lame. And it made me feel as\\nif its sending a message that those who want to be independent, must be\\nbad and that they should go back to their \"natural\" duties. Also it\\nkinda made me sad that although she such an optimist, things never\\nturned out right for her. I absolutely loved the ending scene, brought\\na smile back to my face.At the end, I would recommend the movie and would say it\\'s very\\nenjoyable. Oh, almost forgot that the Italian language is awesome,\\nextremely lovely to hear. Definitely worth of being on the top 250\\nlist.its-lalas-land.blogspot.com\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nMost of us watch a lot of movies in our lives. I saw \"Nights of\\nCabiria\" twelve years ago in a friend\\'s college dorm room. We were all\\nsitting around, and my film student friend popped in \"Nights of\\nCabiria.\" I had no idea what to expect. I had never even heard of the\\nmovie. Talk about the proverbial sucker punch! Cabiria has stayed in my\\nmind ever since, and I find myself thinking about her all the time.\\nThat\\'s the power of this film. There\\'s no need to comment on the acting\\nand directing, which are simply astonishing. What makes this movie so\\nexceptional is the fact that the audience cannot help but fall madly,\\ntragically in love with Cabiria (and of course with Masina). Throughout\\nthe movie, as others have noted, I just wanted to jump into the screen\\nand hug her, save her from those around her and her own naivety. At the\\nend of the day, it is our affection for Cabiria that pushes this movie\\nto the heights of raw, emotional power.And that phenomenon is displayed so beautifully in the famous, magical\\nclosing ten minute sequence. I have to admit, when Oscar stole her\\nmoney on the cliff, and we saw her (yet again) go from the euphoria of\\nbeing in love to rolling on the ground, begging him to kill her, I was\\nfurious. How could Oscar do that to our beloved Cabiria? And more\\nimportantly, how DARE Fellini do this to me!!!! And that was the magic\\nof Fellini. He KNEW that, by this point, the audience was so totally\\ninvested in Cabiria that her heartbreak was our heartbreak. Widely\\nhailed as one of, if not THE most emotionally powerful endings in film\\nhistory, Cabiria\\'s final walk through the forest is simply beyond\\nwords. The explosive power, again, lies in the fact that we care SO\\nmuch for this character, and when she smiles through her tears while\\nwalking among the festival goers, she looks in the camera (and in our\\neyes) and nods, letting us know that she will be okay. It\\'s the most\\ngenerous moment I have ever witnessed in film. I have chills just\\nthinking about it.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nReview:I think you can make the argument that Fellini\\'s \"Juliet of the\\nSpirits\" (1965) is the female counterpoint to his \"8 \\xbd\" (1963). Both\\nare films that analyze a central character whose life seems to be\\ncoming apart at the seams, in large part due to extra-marital affairs\\nand existential concerns. In \"8 \\xbd\" we have the Guido, who wants to tame\\nall the women in his life to restore a semblance of continuity in his\\ncareer and in his existence. With \"Juliet of the Spirits,\" we follow\\nJuliet, a woman who has been shattered by her cheating husband and who\\ndecides to leave him to restore that same sort of continuity of\\nexistence Guido sought.But before \"8 \\xbd\" and \"Juliet of the Spirits\" Fellini made two other\\nfilms that serve as gender based counterpoints \\x96 \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960)\\nand \"Nights of Cabiria.\" (1959). Both films explore similar characters\\nand similar themes. Fellini\\'s heroes in these films are the bottom rung\\nof society and we watch as they try to scrape their way out of their\\npositions in search of greater meaning and purpose. While \"La Dolce\\nVita\" is the superior film, \"Nights of Cabiria\" still holds its own.In recent years \"Nights\" has joined Fellini\\'s \"La Strada\" in accruing a\\nwider and wider audience. Slowly, these films are becoming as widely\\nseen as \"8 \\xbd\" and \"La Dolce Vita.\" \"Nights of Cabiria\" tells the story\\nof Cabiria, a tiny and cute prostitute whose innocence is her greatest\\ncharm and weakness. Fellini buffs will note that we have met Cabiria\\nonce before in Fellini\\'s first feature \"The White Sheik\" (1952). Both\\ntimes she is played by Fellini\\'s wife, the great Giulietta Masina.Masina always has such an expressive face. In some scenes she can\\nexhibit the angelic demeanor of a child and in others she can look as\\nmorose as an old, dying woman. \"Nights of Cabiria\" begins with\\nCabiria\\'s pimp stealing her purse and pushing her into a river. She\\nnearly drowns. When she is saved she is discouraged to understand her\\npimp valued her life less than the 40,000 lira he stole with her purse.\\nCabiria leads a sad existence but she is indomitable. She does not give\\nup, no matter how dire the circumstances.Like with Marcello in \"La Dolce Vita,\" we follow Cabiria through a\\nseries of episodic adventures that mostly take place at night. One\\nnight she gets picked up by a famous movie star who\\'s had a falling out\\nwith his finacee. Another time, Cabiria follows a rhapsodic crowd that\\nlongs to have a vision of the Virgin Mary. Another night she meets a\\nGood Samaritan handing out food to the homeless. With this Samaritan,\\nCabiria meets an older prostitute who used to be a beauty, now living\\ndestitute in a cave outside of Rome. For Cabiria, this woman is a\\nforecast of things to come if she doesn\\'t change her life.Thus, when a nice man comes out of the night, expressing love and his\\nintentions to marry Cabiria, she sees her way out. Are these man\\'s\\nintentions true and honest? I will not give it away - but I will say\\nthat Fellini has a tendency to bookend his films.The final scene of \"Nights of Cabiria\" is beautiful and one of\\nFellini\\'s best endings. It is a synthesis of a parade and a party with\\nCabiria at the center, staring with quiet determination into the\\ncamera. Of all Fellini\\'s vivid images, this one may best encompass his\\nvision of the human experience.Rating:On a scale of one to \"Casablanca\", this film is an \"About Schmidt\"\\n(2003).Rationalization:I think you\\'d be hard pressed to find a person who wouldn\\'t admit that\\nsometimes life can be a series of low-blows and inequities. And yet, we\\nstruggle on, trying to make the best of our situations in an otherwise\\ncruel and indifferent world. Movies like these make me grieve and hope\\nfor humanity, showing us what is best in our natures while never\\ndenying we are pathetic creatures with a loose grip on even our own\\nlives.http://iamdatabasefilmjournal.blogspot.com/\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nNever before have I seen a film so sad and happy at the same time. The\\nfilm stands at the midpoint of these two diverse feelings, and somehow\\nthe ending is able to reconcile the two into a coherent and\\nunderstandable scenario for our favorite Italian prostitute, Cabiria.This is a story that really hinges on the performance of the lead, and\\nit could have gone either way despite Federico Fellini being behind the\\ncamera. Fortunately, his wife was in front of it, and Giuiletta\\nMasina's performance does far more than carry the weight of the plot.\\nShe transcends practically every scene, basing her performance on\\nCharlie Chaplin and dancing as much as she can. Of course we love her,\\nbut more than that we sympathize for her; despite her job we see her as\\nsomeone we might know, sweet and gentle but very naive.Also to be commended is the style in which Fellini documents this\\njourney; we are taken through the seedy undergrounds of Rome some 50\\nyears ago. Cabiria's life has its most unpleasant moments, such as the\\nopening sequence and when she goes home with a famous Italian movie\\nstar, but Fellini always feels for her and so do we. By the time the\\nending arrives, we are utterly ensnared in the short, rather unusual\\nlooking woman. And it is because of the husband and wife team of\\nactress and director that we care about any of these people and are so\\nmoved by what is easily one of the best final scenes in movie history.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nFellini knows how to direct a story, and this one tugs at all of your\\nemotions. It is a simple tale of a woman who wanted better in life. Of\\ncourse from the poor side of the tracks and as she grew up her life\\nhadn\\'t gotten any better, she did have one thing: her dreams. And that,\\nwith her spirit, makes watching the film all worthwhile.Fellini wants you to hope for the best for his character Cabiria\\n(Maria) and Giulietta Masina plays her well. As her life unfolds as a\\nprostitute, she never loses her Cinderella dream while those around her\\ncrush it in every which way possible. But she does meet her \"prince\",\\nand she is led to believe her story will end \"happily ever after\", and\\nthat\\'s when we the audience is let in for a shock of horrific\\nproportions. But, as we sit and watch this unfold, Fellini delivers\\nskillfully what only Fellini can; and in that, we sigh with relief as\\nwe are still on Cabiria\\'s side of love and hope.Filmmed in Black and White (subtitled) with all the artistry and\\nrawness of Fellini, this is the type of picture that makes you fall in\\nlove with film and story. No special effects, no contrived love story.\\nThis is done as if these are folks you know and see everyday. You can\\'t\\nreally turn away, you want to know what\\'s next. Excellent film.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI\\'ve never seen a Federico Fellini movie that I didn\\'t like, and \"Le\\nnotti di Cabiria\" is certainly another great one, telling the story of\\nnaive but self-standing prostitute Cabiria (Giulietta Masina) wondering\\nthrough Rome looking for love but never finding it. Whether she gets\\npushed into the river (and then gets angry when the boys saving her\\ndon\\'t know where the man went), or acts out a childhood scene for a\\nhypnotist, or gets involved with a movie star, Cabiria never loses\\nfaith in her aim.I thought that the two most effective scenes in the movie were the\\nchurch and the movie star\\'s house. In the church, there\\'s an invalid\\nhoping to get cured, but it doesn\\'t happen, much like how Cabiria never\\nattains her goal; not even in the seemingly holiest of places can\\npeople come across what they seek. In the movie star\\'s house, she has\\nto walk up a staircase to get to his room. The camera angle faces up,\\nmaking it look as though she is walking up to heaven and can finally\\nget what she wants. But she doesn\\'t, and then walks back down the\\nstairs. They film it from above, so that it looks as though she has to\\nleave this fantasy world that she had entered and come back down to\\nreality. (Note: this is all conjecture, so don\\'t quote me.) All in all,\\nFellini accomplished another masterpiece here. Part of what\\'s so great\\nabout the movie is how he introduces the characters. Not just Cabiria,\\nbut also her prostitute friends, and how men pick them up. It\\'s a movie\\nthat I recommend to everyone. Even if you\\'re the type who only likes\\nHollywood movies saturated with mindless action, you at least gotta\\ngive this movie a try.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI have seen many great films, many films that I would have to admit are\\ntechnically greater than this. But very, very few films have ever\\nevoked such beauty and warmth than Fellini\\'s \"Nights of Cabiria\". There\\nis a certain poetry and honesty that haunts every frame in this film,\\nand while the writing is beautiful, after the film is over you don\\'t\\nremember the dialogue, or even the story. You remember the moments, the\\nfaces, the images, the places where this film takes place.I have never cried during or after a movie, and I don\\'t think I ever\\nwill. But \"Nights of Cabiria\" moved me as close to tears as I think any\\nfilm will ever have the power to do.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI first saw this film at 22. As the lights came up in the theater I was\\nopenly weeping- Not just tears but actual sobs. I sat there alone a\\ngoodly amount of time until I believed the theater was empty. When I\\nlooked up another woman and a man were still seated. We all smiled at\\neach other, and left without speaking. Masina is called a female Chaplin by some- Frankly, she is better.I\\nhave also read criticisms of her for this. Why? Must we separate\\ntheater and film? Her facial expressions confirm that communication is\\nonly 40% verbalThe \"man with the sack\" scene was not censored by the church- If\\nanything this film is very pro- catholicism; temptation vs salvation.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nDisagreeing with many of Federico Fellini\\'s opinions, I don\\'t deny that\\nhe has not belonged to the list of my favorite directors. Some of his\\nmovies are really difficult and a bit psychedelic. However, I have to\\nadmit one thing clearly: Fellini was one of the few men in cinema who\\nwas able to create something really powerful, captivating, enthralling,\\ncontroversial, something really innovative: and that is what one may\\nundeniably say about NIGHTS OF CABIRIA, his 1957 movie where again,\\nafter marvelous LA STRADA, he cast his wife Giulietta Masina in the\\nlead, a performance that may be regarded as one beyond any awards. But\\nlet me analyze the content of the movie first before I comment on\\nacting.Cabiria, an outsider among outsiders who is \"living the life\" is a\\nRoman prostitute whom we find rather individual and with whom, from the\\nvery beginning, we can easily empathize. She is robbed, thrown to the\\nTiber River and, fortunately, rescued by a group of men. From this \"in\\nmedia res\" opening moment, we start to get to know her. In spite of\\nCabiria\\'s profession, she is not that \"immoral.\" What Cabiria gets\\nthrough is disappointment. She cannot understand that someone who\\nalways said \"I love you\" stole a few thousand Lira and was going to\\nkill her. Although she seems to have a friend at her side, Wanda\\n(Franca Marzi), also a prostitute, she feels lonely and desperate. The\\ndirector masterfully supplies us with Cabiria\\'s physical and\\npsychological journey through different places, realities...something\\nvery life-like. Therefore, the movie appears to be built upon various\\nworlds=various moments that do not have much in common with one another\\nbut which constitute a perfect integration at a higher level of life\\nanalysis. This is rather a series of events than a linear plot and...\\nthese events are really unforgettable being embedded in highly\\nunpredictable action.Perfect harmony, wonderful insights into social realities, memorable,\\ninnovative, brave (as for these times) MOMENTS. Fellini appears to draw\\na parallel between Cabiria\\'s experiences and everyone\\'s life. Consider,\\nfor instance, the main motifs why she goes to these different places:\\nshe wants to find herself, looks for happiness, looks for love. Does\\nshe find it? Difficult to say... I particularly loved the moment she is\\nso confused in a luxurious house of a famous film star, Alberto Lazzari\\n(Amedeo Nazzari), but, from the social point of view, so lucky to get\\nthe autograph of his. But does this autograph give her satisfaction? A\\ndifferent must see moment is the visit to the Sanctuary of the Amore\\nDivina - a pure realism of people in prayer trance shouting \"Grazie\\nMadonna!\" Cabiria seems to be touched by them but is she able to ask\\nMadonna for the right thing? Events are one factor why I really\\nappreciate this film.Another reason for my love to this movie are the top notch\\nperformances. The cast, particularly Giulietta Masina (foremost she),\\nmake NIGHTS OF CABIRIA nearly a masterpiece. Giulietta Masina patterns\\nher acting on purely original building block of cinema\\'s charm which is\\nFACE. That is where you can read her feelings, that is where you\\nrealize what is going on. As a matter of fact, dialog is only an\\nadditional aspect when applied to her. From portraying anger,\\ndisappointment, confusion, trance, hope, to affection, sorrow and yet\\nan optimistic smile, Giulietta is a marvel! I would not compare her\\nacting to the ones in other Fellini movies, including LA STRADA and\\nJULIET OF THE SPIRITS, because she is unique as Cabiria, the same as\\nshe is unique in the roles of Gelsomina or Giulietta! The supporting\\ncast also give fine performances, particularly Francois Perier as Oscar\\nD\\'Onofrio, Amedeo Nazzari as Alberto and Franca Marzi as Wanda,\\nseemingly Cabiria\\'s real friend.But for me what will always play a decisive role after seeing this\\nmovie is the specific Italian charm of long ago. This is something I\\nfound in many old Italian movies and and that is something Fellini\\nmanaged to entail here like other geniuses of cinema from his country.\\nThe film is nice to watch but not light to watch, it has reflections\\nbut also relaxation, all is in its right place. Moreover, all is\\nenriched by the wonderful music by Nino Rota, a genius with whom\\nFellini worked with many other movies.As one reviewer before me has already stated, NIGHTS OF CABIRIA is like\\nCabiria\\'s or Giulietta\\'s smile, the smile of optimism, the smile of\\nlong ago, the smile that after 50 years still moves us and uplifts us.\\nWhat was happiness for Cabiria? Was it the luxury she found in\\nAlberto\\'s life? Was it a group of pilgrims she joined? Was it Frate\\nGiovanni who insisted on maintaining the Grace of God? She illusively\\nfound her angel in D\\'Onofrio; yet the truth occurred entirely\\ndifferent. What is happiness for us? Have we found it or is it just like in\\nCabiria\\'s life...it passes by as such an unnoticeable, simple thing and\\nwe look for it and expect it in totally wrong places? Great movie as a\\nreal experience and touching empathy with the heroine. 9/10! If it\\'s\\none of the first Fellini\\'s films that you see, you\\'re on the right\\ntrack!\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nFederico Fellini directed his wife, Giuletta Masina, in some of her and\\nhis most memorable screen work. Nights of Cabiria may be high up there,\\nperhaps the most exciting. The film carries an episodic storyline that\\nfollows our heroine Cabiria as she has to use a hard act of cynicism\\nand street-wise attitude to cover up a girlyish interior. Run-ins with\\na celebritie and other louse-abouts, a visit to a church, and a\\nlife-changing bit on a magician's stage, and most of these sequences\\nare filmed superbly. Not only is there Fellini's usual under-current of\\nlaughs, but a perfect sense of imagination behind the on-location sets\\nand real-life actors.I've seen this and La Strada now (Masina's other notable work), and I\\nfeel a little more inclined to go with this one as the better. Some\\ncritics have written that Fellini's films, in the evolution of his\\ncareer, show a gaining momentum up till 8 1/2. Although I'd have to see\\nboth each a second go-around, Nights of Cabiria had me enthralled and\\namazed for the whole two hours. There's something so appealing about a\\ncharacter like Cabiria that's pulled off without a hitch, even into the\\nseemingly 'easy' third act. Add another fantastic Nina Rota score,\\nfascinating supporting cast, and a genuine ideology behind the\\nenvironment of Cabiria's world, and it's a winner. This is the kind of\\nfilm that COULD have appealed more so to women than men, but as it\\nstands, the film holds up as a great romantic character study for\\nanyone. A+\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nSpoilers herein.I suppose there are many who believe this to be a character study, or\\nperhaps social criticism. I don't think so -- I believe this to be Fellini's\\nfirst film concerned with the nature of what film is: part prostitution,\\npart promised miracle; part mesmerised fantasy; part romantic\\npretense.And that's how this film is constructed, four set pieces dealing with these\\nfour ideas:-- The film actor as reluctant prostitute-- The masses flocking to the madonna based on the magic of the ritual\\nperformance-- The audience being hypnotized by watching someone be\\nhypnotized-- The play that is behind love, and all it is, is a play for money (which\\nconnects to the small sequence in the beginning)This is definitely worth watching, and it has historical significance as\\nwell. But I think it s pretty weak Fellini so far as the visual elements and\\nthe narrative adventure. So many of the dramatic metaphors are peculiarly\\nItalian -- somehow they don't translate to the universal as well as say the\\nJapanese of Kurosawa.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nCabiria is a prostitute in her 30s. Short and not as pretty as her\\ncolleagues either. She lost her parents when she was little so she was\\nnever educated or cultured and you can see all this in her character.The first scene shows her being pushed into a river by her boyfriend\\n(pimp too I guess) who just wants to steal her handbag. She gets\\nrescued by some kids and some local people but when she wakes up she\\nabsolutely doesn't care about them and is very rude and bad to them.\\nShe has had such a hard life, a life where people just use her, a life\\nof no love or respect that most of her mind is just callous.But as we spend time with her, we slowly see that, just like anybody,\\nshe too just wants to be loved. But its subtle. She has been burned so\\nmany many times that trust is 'extremely' difficult for her.By the end of the movie, we will fall in love with her. You just want\\nto hug her close, kiss her and tell her that she is truly loved for who\\nshe and that she will not be harmed. That is how good the acting by\\nGiulietta Masina is (the story too). She has the most expressive eyes\\nthat I have seen on screen. If she was in Hollywood, she may have been\\none of the greatest actresses of all times! This movie is also not for\\neveryone. Its a sort of slice-of-life of just one person, so it doesn't\\nhave a conclusive ending. Its not a, she lived happily ever after or\\nshe died or she achieved that, kind of movie. And you really need to be\\nolder, seen pain, understood the meaning of loneliness, what society\\nis, what people want, etc., to see the heart and reason behind\\neverything.Movie is on the levels of Tokyo Story, so do see it.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nRome, 1957. A woman, Cabiria, is robbed and left to drown by her\\nboyfriend, Giorgio. Rescued, she resumes her life and tries her best to\\nfind happiness in a cynical world. Even when she thinks her struggles\\nare over and she has found happiness and contentment, things may not be\\nwhat they seem.Wonderfully engaging movie from Federico Fellini. There's a lightness\\nand sweetness about the main character that makes her easy to support.\\nSome great comedy too. It's not all wine-and-roses though. There is a fair amount of struggle,\\nbitterness and cynicism involved. The ending is particularly cynical,\\npossibly too cynical. I am generally not in favour of Hollywood,\\nhappily-ever-after, endings but this story deserved a bit more\\nhappiness and closure than it ended with.While Fellini pulls the strings to perfection, it is the performance of\\nGiulletta Masina as Cabiria who makes the movie. Street-wise and sassy\\nyet sweet and vulnerable. Very funny, yet able to convey great sadness\\nand struggle too. Some of her physical comedy is Chaplinesque in its\\nbrilliance. Her performance spans the whole gamut of human emotions and\\nexpressions and she does it incredibly well. Incredibly engaging and it\\nis this engagement that makes the movie so great.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nNIGHTS OF CABIRIA, Fellini sixth feature film, which marks that he has\\nassertively reached the full- blown phrase in his creativity and\\nsleight-of-hand at the age of 37, and anticipates the acme of his\\ncareer, LA VOLCE VITA (1960) and 8 AND A HALF (1963). The story (with\\nPasolini inside the coterie as a collaborator), is a tale of woe about\\na roadside streetwalker Cabiria (Masina) in Rome, whose real name is\\nMaria Ceccarelli.In the opening long shot, we see Cabiria gambols with his beau on a\\nSunny day in the field near a river, and quick as lightning, he grabs\\nher handbag and pushes her into the water. Cabiria is almost drowned,\\nthe same course of events will (almost) replicate itself in the\\narresting culmination, this time, with another suitor, a well-groomed\\nbut greasy self-claimed accountant Oscar (P\\xe9rier). Why Cabiria hasn\\'t\\nlearn anything from her miseries? It is much easier to shoot out\\npointers in post- mortem, in fact, as we audience follows closely to\\nthese non-interrelated episodes of Cabiria\\'s experiences, her wretched\\ndestiny doesn\\'t strike more like a subjectively injudicious decision\\nthan a fusillade of flak targeting at the injustice of contemporary\\nsociety and the worst of human vice.Cabiria is petite, petulant and starry-eyed, apart from a narrow escape\\nfrom death thanks to her dastard boyfriend, she is perfectly content in\\nher own achievement, her self-reliant means of earning secures her a\\nhouse of her own and some savings in the bank, even during her\\nserendipitous \"one-night-stand\" with a famous movie star, Alberto\\nLazzari (Nazzari in his Erroyl Flynn suaveness), in his palatial villa,\\nshe is not ashamed of her bog-standard house. Only when she peers from\\nthe keyhole of the star\\'s bathroom when Alberto romantically reconciles\\nwith his trophy girlfriend Jessy (Gray), she realises there is\\nsomething missing in her life.A pilgrimage with other working girls jolts her out of her hard earned\\nfulfilment, she transforms from a non-believer to a devotee, daydreams\\na miracle will bestow on her. After religious epiphany, next in line is\\nprestidigitation, Fellini cunningly alludes to the collusion between\\nthem, religion seduces a simple soul and illusion brings her the\\nundoing. In the hypnotic performance, a cynical Cabiria unwittingly\\nreveals herself, the inner child, a love-longing Maria Ceccarelli,\\nwhich instigates Oscar, a spectator in the audience to conspire his\\nact. Since manifestly Cabiria is not an accomplice of the magician\\n(Silvani), then her state-of-hypnosis is indeed real, which is boldly\\nagainst the common savvy, and can be perceived as a further tactic to\\nturn realness-and-illusion topsy-turvy, with the sudden arrival of a\\nPrince Charming, willing to marry her and doesn\\'t want to know anything\\nabout her past, only with an ulterior motive.Giulietta Masina, what can I say, such a godsend to her hubby, a force\\nof nature can effortlessly entice a viewer to vicariously discern and\\nundergo her character\\'s emotional trajectory, all the more she provoke\\nimmense sympathy along the way, the suspense-heightened final\\nrevelation is so gut-wrenching to watch yet it is completely\\ncaptivating and emotive (bolstered by Nino Rota\\'s sublimely emotionally\\nmanipulative score). What a triumphant performance, Cannes\\' BEST\\nACTRESS honour has never been so worthy!NIGHTS OF CABIRIA won BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE in the Oscar race,\\na consecutive second win for Fellini after LA STRADA (1954), unlike its\\ntragic protagonist Gesumina, also played by Masina, who succumbs to the\\nhardship and abandonment, in the coda, Cabiria manages to squeeze a\\nsmile through her tears with a parade of people singing and dancing\\naround her, like a phoenix back from the ash, the message is uplifting,\\nshe may be homeless and penniless, but she has a true friend Wanda (an\\nace Marzi, in her very naturalistic mien) to rely on, she can go on\\nworking the next day and start every from the scratch, what can not\\nkill you only makes you stronger, girl!

       " u'\\nA waifish prostitute (Giulietta Masina) wanders the streets of Rome\\nlooking for true love but finds only heartbreak.I do not feel confident critiquing this film, as it is the first\\nFederico Fellini film I have seen. Sure, one should be able to judge a\\nfilm on its own merits, but I feel like it would be more fair to put\\nthis one in context of his overall career, seeing as this was 55 years\\nago...Bosley Crowther gave the film a mixed review, saying \"this one is aimed\\nmore surely toward the development of a theme than a plot. Its interest\\nis not so much the conflicts that occur in the life of the heroine as\\nthe deep, underlying implications of human pathos that the pattern of\\nher life shows... But there are two weaknesses in Cabiria. It has a\\nsordid atmosphere and there is something elusive and insufficient about\\nthe character of the heroine. Her get-up is weird and illogical for the\\nmilieu in which she lives and her farcical mannerisms clash with the\\nugly realism of the theme.\" I include this here merely to show how time\\nhas aged this film well -- no critic today would come down so harsh on\\nFellini.What I actually found most interesting was the producer being Dino De\\nLaurentiis. Now, that in itself is not strange, because he has produced\\na great many things (and other Fellini films). But again, looking back\\n50 years, Dino is known for his involvement in horror and science\\nfiction. It is interesting to see he had such a distinguished\\nbeginning. Most people in film start in horror and then go legit, not\\nthe other way around.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nLike others, I'm tempted to say this is the greatest film I've seen in\\nmy whole life; and I am already 73! That's a lot of movies! This is the\\ngreatest of all! I can't say it's on account of Masina; an actress of\\nwonderful talent. Because, in some of her other Fellini roles, she\\ndidn't come across as this stupendous. Then it must be what her\\nhusband, the inimitable Fellini did for her acting. That's more likely.\\nEveryone knows he was a genius. Giulietta Masina as Cabiria may have\\nbeen a stroke of that genius, matched with an unforgettable Nino Rota\\nfilm score, and the undying magic of Rome. Masina was a RIOT of\\nfeminine personality and rose to Fellini's greatest occasion in film.\\nAll the actors in this gem of a movie are splendid! Now; there is a lovely spiritual aspect to Nights of Cabiria. I suspect\\nhardly anybody in the millions who have seen Cabiria over many years\\nrealizes it. Now we'll have a spoiler with the secret aspect realized: Despite her facade of insouciance and exuberance; Cabiria is dejected\\nat the squalor of her prostitution; and how men have exploited her\\nonce-innocent youth. She reveals it for a fleeting moment. Before the\\nostensibly miraculous image of the Virgin, Cabiria breaks down and\\npleads: For a change in her hopeless life.In the following scenes, disappointment sets in. Both for her and\\nothers in the so-called pilgrimage. Her acting, of a slightly rummy\\nprostitute laughing at the notion of innocence and faith, becomes\\nliterally heartbreaking. Only Giulietta could have played these scenes.Rather than continue on the spoiler sequence and a final denouement; I\\nsuggest viewers hereafter pay attention during the much-admired ending.\\nEveryone knows by now she's leaving Rome. She's disposed of her\\nproperty and for love's sake Cabiria puts her past behind her. Then\\nwe're led to see her last agony toward the end. While Rota's absolutely\\nsmashing score is played by a group of adolescents, she sheds one last\\ntear and smiles into Fellini's camera. Because her prayer before the\\nVirgin is answered. It's been very painful, but her life has changed at\\nlast!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nI'm sure, like many, I first set eyes on the then Mrs Fellini, Giuletta\\nMasina, who stars as Cabiria, as the stray little clown in La Strada,\\nwho was sold to Anthony Quinn's cruel one-man performing act. I'm glad\\nthat I bought and viewed the two DVDs in this order.How the character developed in La Strada was extraordinarily compelling\\nand at its conclusion, I was in distress and tears. I was also in tears\\nat the end of Cabiria, for different reasons, of which I'll keep to\\nmyself, so as to not spoil for others.Cabiria, is a plucky little prostitute in a poor, run-down Rome area\\nwhose sassy lip and terrier like fight-back saves her bacon, many\\ntimes. From an attempted drowning at the start, to being a distracting\\nplaything for a film star who gets back with his mistress in front of\\nCabiria's eyes.There's always that fiery competition and catty dialogue one presumes\\nstreet-girls the world over are forever rattling off. Bettering\\nthemselves, moving on, meeting Mr Right etc. Her entanglements are\\ncounterbalanced by that other Fellini (La Dolce Vita especially)\\nfascination, the Catholic church. Cabiria isn't a fallen angel, just\\none that's stuck in a degrading and constricting 'profession', always\\nat the mercy of someone else.Eventually, she believes she meets her Intended-to-be. The immense joy\\nthat radiates from that wide-eyed face of hers then; but at other times\\ncan send rods of acute sadness through you in seconds just by a held\\nexpression. Maybe, she's the original Meryl Streep, in that, even\\nwithout dialogue, her face alone can express a whole scene. Direction\\nfrom one's husband obviously helps.Really very good films generally don't get more than a 9/10 from me.\\nThere is always a sliver of room for improvement in 99.9 of films. To\\nget a 10, it has to have a profound, personal effect on me. This did\\nand whilst not having any idea how the film was going to end, my\\nemotions went through every scenario - and back again. When it was in\\nan unexpected way, I just knew that it was the only way that Cabiria,\\nas we'd got to know her, and love her, WOULD have made it.This is an absolute must for anybody and everybody, who has a TV (or\\nPC, or Ipad, or whatever). I'm still bristling with feelings from it,\\n12 hours after seeing it.\\n\",\n",

It seems each time someone serious takes an interest\\nin her, it\\'s for some reason other than true love. I still haven\\'t seen\\ntoo many Fellini movies in my life but the ones I have seen have left\\nme rather cold even though I was highly impressed with the talent shown\\nin them. I was really looking forward to this one and as it would turn\\nout this here is my favorite that I\\'ve seen from the director so far. I\\nread quite a few reviews before watching this and each of them seemed\\nto have a different opinion on the film. Some called it a chic flick.\\nSome called it a black comedy. Some called it a depressing nightmare.\\nThe one thing I agreed most with was a critic who compared it to a\\nfemale version of Chaplin\\'s Little Tramp character. I think what works\\nso well about the film is that it contains a little bit of everything\\nand all of these emotions are perfectly pulled off by Masina who turns\\nin a masterful performance and really makes this character one of the\\nmost memorable female roles in film history. I think she perfectly\\nnails the darker side of the comedy in scenes like the beginning when\\nshe returns home after her \"true love\" trying to drown her by pushing\\nher in the lake. The scene with her on the bed is so sad it\\'s\\nhilarious. I think she also does a great job in terms of being a woman\\nsimply wanting love. The innocence of this dream really comes across as\\nsomething very touching and something we want her to find. Then, there\\nare the darker moments that I won\\'t ruin but she again nails these\\nperfectly. There have been countless films with women playing\\nprostitutes and quite often people joke that this is the type of role\\nany actress would want to play and I can\\'t help but wonder if that\\nfeeling started here. I guess it goes without saying that Masina was\\noverlooked at the Oscars this year. Fellini\\'s touch is also on hand and\\nI thought that for the most part he kept the film moving very well,\\nalthough I didn\\'t care too much for the scene that was added to prints\\nin 1998 with the mysterious man delivering the blankets. Outside of\\nthis scene the director handles the various emotions quite well and the\\nbeautiful photography really jumps out at one.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n'Le notti di Cabiria' is a wonderful film who survived very well the\\nhalf century since it was made and can be seen today with the same\\nemotion. Much of the secret of this survival over time is due to the\\nsplendid creation of Giulietta Masina, who in the role of Cabiria\\ncreates one of these universal characters that belongs to the family of\\nChaplin's Charlot - a woman who dreams to overcome her condition and\\nkeeps her humanity and her determination despite the repeated hits that\\nlife and destiny pour on her. Over an over again she is brought to\\nbelieve that she can reach absolution and happiness, by means of\\ndreams, by means of people, by means of religion, yet every tie she is\\ndeceived, just to raise again and get back to fighting life with her\\nunforgettable smile among tears. The film is very well made, and\\nrepresents a milestone of the evolution of Fellini from the\\nneorealistic films of the first part of his career to the more\\nsophisticated and aesthetic movies of the next decades.

       " u\"\\nBefore Federico Fellini became the audacious and surrealistic film\\nauteur of the 1960s he was a lauded and accomplished Italian\\nNeorealistic film director of the 1950s, more in league with Vittorio\\nDe Sica and Lucchino Visconti, and no film better represents this era\\nof Fellini's art than his sterling 1957 film Nights Of Cabiria (Le\\nNotti Di Cabiria), written by Fellini, Tulio Pinelli, and Ennio Flaiano\\n(with Pier Paolo Pasolini scripting the Roman street slang), and\\nstarring his wife Giulieta Masina. It won the 1957 film Oscar for Best\\nForeign Film, and deservedly so. The film deals with the trials and\\ntribulations of the impoverished and downtrodden in a humorous but\\nrealistic way that Hollywood still does not dare to do. Yet, even in\\nthis film, one can see the filmmaker that Fellini was to become in a\\nfew years, for, despite its seeming realism, there are many neat\\ntouches of Absurdism, Symbolism, and Surrealism\\x85. In many ways, the\\nfilm is a picaresque of one of the oldest clich\\xe9s: the hooker with the\\nheart of gold, but such a generalization utterly disservices the 'how'\\nof how art affects one, and how it does its task. Masina's brilliant\\nperformance, which won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film\\nFestival, is often compared to Chaplin's tramp character, even though\\nit is more like Lucille Ball's TV character of Lucy Ricardo, from I\\nLove Lucy, albeit with depth, delicacy, and heart; such a depth of a\\ncharacter that a lesser actress would have let descend into burlesque.\\nYet, Cabiria's expressiveness is more subtle and true than either\\nChaplin's or Ball's characters, for they exist only in comedies, and\\nNights Of Cabiria is not a comedy, despite some funny moments. Cabiria\\nexists in a far more complex and realistic world than the Tramp or Lucy\\nRicardo. Her face contorts into twists of pain Lucy Ricardo never\\ndreamt of, and which the Tramp simply shrugged off, or responded to\\nwith wild slapstick. Cabiria is wary, mistrusts, and does not seem to\\nlearn, frustrating both her and the audience she has gotten to root for\\nher. I knew many such women in my New York neighborhood while growing\\nup. And they can be tough, street smart, yet still gullible enough to\\nfall for an Oscar. That said, critics have disagreed, over the years,\\nover whether or not Oscar was conning Cabiria from the start. I think\\nit's clear he was, for from her answers to the mesmerist he felt she\\nwas an independent woman of means, assuming a poor woman would never\\neven go to such a show. One can even see from their scene of meeting at\\nthe train station that Oscar is putting on an act, changing his facial\\nexpressions the moment he sees her, dropping a toothpick from his\\nmouth, after looking like the consummate con man, and then assuming a\\nweak demeanor to lure Cabiria into his trap. That the woman who makes\\nher living in sex is still so na\\xefve to the ways of emotional sexual\\ninvolvement says a lot of Fellini's prescience in parsing out realities\\nof character development. Then, when he found out she was a prostitute,\\nhe felt a bit guilty, as if preying on someone from his own class, and\\nthus wanted to not know of her 'job'. A part of him, it seems, wants to\\nnot con her, at the cliff, and this was why his demeanor is so\\ndifferent. Yet, ultimately, he's a con, she's a whore, and reality\\ndictates they act their parts. But, unlike Giorgio, he is no would be\\nkiller. The only question is what his initial con was to be- to marry a\\nwoman of means, and then, failing that, to just take Cabiria's money\\nthe moment he saw it, knowing his original plan was dead, for he could\\nnot sponge off of her. Such small ambiguities, even if not pertinent to\\nCabiria's ultimate unhappiness, nor the film's ending, makes Fellini an\\nartist of the first rank, for only such artists pay attention to such\\nthings. These things, not the great things, are often the difference\\nbetween greats and minor artists.These sorts of subtleties in common folk are never even broached, much\\nless dealt with, in modern Hollywood films. Such is the richness of\\nthis marvelous study in class and self-deception, where humans live in\\nsmall concrete boxes they call homes, as if lab rats. That the film\\ndoes not follow a conventional narrative format is a good thing, for it\\nheightens the realistic sense of the film. It also subtly repudiates\\nreligion, although not so much in the overtly religious scenes, where\\nCabiria's spiritual entreaties go unheard, nor where she mocks the\\nreligiots as fools, but in those scenes where Cabiria reveals her most\\nhuman side, the non-fantastic, which is ironic, since she works in a\\nprofession that deals with fantasy. The film also deals with survival,\\nat its basest level, for Cabiria barely grows intellectually through\\nthe film. Yes, by film's end, one could argue that her latest user and\\nabuser, Oscar, is a step up from Giorgio, whom she began the film with,\\nbut has Cabiria really ameliorated?To close, Nights Of Cabiria owes much to City Lights for its focus on\\nthe poor, as well as to De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, for its realistic\\nview of life at a certain time and place, especially its end, which\\nsimply ends, with no indication of whether or not Cabiria will be\\nbetter off or not, and this helps viewers more strongly identify with\\nher, because we all are unknowing and uncertain of our futures, and\\neven though Cabiria's uncertainty is half a century removed, the tingle\\nwe get in our bellies, at the film's end is a recognition of our fears\\nin her gaze toward us, and despite it's unsettling effect, such\\nbutterflies still flap their wings for the future.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nEver since I was bored to tears by both 8 1/2 and La Dolce Vita;\\nFederico Fellini hasn't been at the top of my favourite directors list.\\nHowever, he went up a little in my estimation after I saw La Strada,\\nand Night of Cabiria ensures that my opinion of him has risen further\\nstill. The film is a very bleak portrayal of the life of a young woman\\nin Italy, who becomes the victim of several men; but isn't completely\\nblameless herself. The film starts with a sequence that sees this\\nwoman, named Cabiria, dumped into a river shortly before her purse is\\nstolen by her supposed 'love'. Any sympathy we have for her is quickly\\nlost after she is rescued by some helpful villagers, and proceeds to\\nmock their rescue by being very rude indeed. The central character is\\nvery hard to like, as she's seriously lacking in good points; but this\\nseems to be the point of the movie. Cabiria doesn't treat others very\\nwell, and as such; she doesn't get a good deal very often herself. The\\ncharacter is never really allowed to develop - she always has the same\\nmotives, but her situation changes around her - and Fellini gives us a\\ncinematic interpretation of the old proverb 'a leopard never changes\\nits spots'.The film takes place largely in the downtrodden areas of Rome. Fellini\\ndoes an excellent job of enforcing the character's situation on his\\naudience, and the black and white cinematography helps to ensure that\\nthe movie always looks suitably bleak. This film represents a reunion\\nbetween director Federico Fellini and his La Strada star Giulietta\\nMasina. Masina delivers an energetic performance, which ensures that\\nthe film is never boring; but it also means that her character often\\nappears over the top, and the film loses credibility because of that.\\nTo be honest, I don't think this actress suits the film too well. She\\nfit her role in La Strada like a glove, and it may be for that reason\\nthat she is hard to accept in such a different persona. Anyway, the\\nstyle of the film is great; Fellini ensures that the film feels very\\nItalian, and this combined with the energy from the lead makes the film\\nmore enjoyable than quite a few similar art films. The ending is great,\\nand fits everything leading up to it brilliantly. This is the only way\\nthe film could have ended properly; making the climax both fitting and\\nsatisfying. Overall, Nights of Cabiria is an excellent classic film and\\none that I recommend to fans of art cinema.\\n\",\n",
       " u'Add another review',\n",
       " u'*** This review may contain spoilers ***',\n",
       " u'\\n\\n(Some spoilers below)\\nThis film is about illusions, and how everybody - individuals,\\ngovernments,\\nperformers, religions, actors, prostitutes, film directors - exploits\\nthem\\nfor their own ends. Some do so in ways which are harmful to others. Some,\\nlike Cabiria, harm themselves.Fellini\\'s examination of illusion draws on a rich tradition, particularly\\nin\\nEuropean theatre (the dominance of \"seeming\" over \"being\", illusion and\\ndeception over honesty, goes right back to Hamlet and beyond).The film is structured around a series of expositions of illusion,\\ninvolving\\na bogus lover, a famous actor, a pilgrimage, a variety show, and,\\nfinally,\\nto close the circle...a bogus lover again. Add in the fact that the\\ncentral\\ncharacter is a prostitute...I think you\\'re starting to get the\\npicture.So if all is illusion, why watch the film? Because the central purveyor\\n(and, more importantly, victim) of illusion (the prostitute Cabiria) is a\\nconvincingly-portrayed, complex character who exhibits a tough,\\nlife-affirming drive to take on the world (in the best Camusian, post-war\\nexistentialist sense). It is this that makes the film such an\\nexhilarating\\nexperience. Millions of people in Italy and all over Europe in the 1940\\'s\\nand 1950\\'s had to live in a world which had utterly collapsed. In this\\nworld, one did what one could to get by, and religion, love, sensual\\npleasure, and, of course, the cinema, offered only brief respite from the\\neveryday realities.The classic neo-realist edge-of-city building-site sets add the requisite\\ntouch of alienation and barrenness to the action.\\nBut this is not the kind of hardline neo-realist tract satirized by\\nNichetti\\nin \"The Icicle Thief\". Fellini\\'s natural sense of cinema as fantasy\\nenables\\nthe viewer to feel good at the end of a film where no conventional\\nfeelgood\\nfactor is offered. And surely that\\'s an achievement in\\nitself.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nIn this masterpiece by a great director, Fellini tells of the prostitute\\nCabiria who spends the entire movie searching for love without ever actually\\nhaving sex.  I know what you\\'re thinking: \"Ra-ra; that sounds boring. Wrong.At the heart of this film is a feminist who is coming into her own.  The\\naudience feels her heartbreak as she goes from man to man looking for \"the\\none.\"  As a guy, I must say that I started to hate men.  I guess that\\'s sort\\nof the point.  Cabiria\\'s character is essentially an innocent, and it is\\nhard to watch people take advantage of innocents (and innocence).  Well\\nFellini makes you sit through it, and the effect is awesome.When it finally seems as if Cabiria has found the right man, the viewer\\ncannot help but to be wary after all of the s**t she had to go through with\\nthe others.  Is the viewer right?  What do you think?The final shot gives me chills (the good kind).  It stands as a testament to\\nthe independence of womankind and their strength to persevere when they are\\nleft with nothing.Awesome.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nWith her short stature, small round face, big eyes, and ponytail,\\nCabiria makes for a memorable character. And actress Giulietta Masina\\nplays the part well. She exudes emotional depth, and an abundance of\\nanimated expressions. But through most of the film, Cabiria\\'s attitude\\nis too belligerent to render her sympathetic. Yes, she has lots to\\ncomplain about. But early in the film, we don\\'t know that. And the\\nexpressiveness that makes her so endearing in the last Act makes her\\ncallous at the start.\"Nights Of Cabiria\" is a typical Fellini film, in that it lacks basic\\nplot structure. Instead of weaving a unified story from an underlying\\npremise, the film mostly presents viewers with a series of unrelated\\nvignettes. We see Cabiria in varying situations, and how she reacts to\\nan assortment of secondary characters. But these vignettes are\\npresented in structural isolation. Only toward the end does Fellini\\nbegin to connect the dots, and thereby compose a cinematic portrait\\nthat is thematically coherent.Not only does the screen story lack structure, the dialogue is\\nmaddeningly talky. And again, most of the chatter is battling and\\nargumentative. It gets stale, quickly.Visually, the film looks great. The B&W cinematography conveys\\nwonderful lighting contrast, especially in the nighttime scenes, along\\nwith a variety of camera angles and interesting compositions. The\\nbackground music also contributes to the film\\'s artistic feel.Overall, however, the film\\'s structural weakness, the expressed\\nhostility, and the talky dialogue burden the film to the point that I\\njust can\\'t recommend it, except to viewers who naturally gravitate to\\nFellini\\'s unorthodox style of film-making.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nFederico Fellini\\'s \"Nights of Cabiria\" is of all his films perhaps the\\nmost representative of the filmmaker and his art - it displays his\\ncinematic genius, his ability to draw out fantastic performances from\\nactors, his deluge of empathy, and his greatest weakness. Allow me to\\nexplain; for Fellini, much of life and art are a circus. This can be\\nseen in the comic touch of \"I Vitteloni\", the farcically random events\\nof \"8 1/2\", and in the three-ring music of Nina Rota. The theme of life\\nas a circus is all very well, but it sometimes leaves you hanging - as\\nif the movie will continue forever but you, the viewer, will not. This\\nis the problem with \"Nights of Cabiria\" - it is the tale of a young\\nprostitute who is trying to find some kind of salvation. She at first\\ntries to find it in boyfriend, moves on to a movie star, then attempts\\nto attain it through religion, and finally tries to discover it in love\\n- but salvation seems forever out of reach, for each of those things\\nlisted above ultimately fail her, and thus the movie fails to really\\nend; it simply goes on piping and marching as the viewer sits wondering\\nwhere s/he is left. For these reasons, \"Nights of Cabiria\" doesn\\'t\\nfully work; but this is not to damn it, for it is for the most part a\\nheart-wrenching, beautiful, and powerful film. 7.5/10\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nOf course, \"Le Notti di Cabiria\" is a superior work compared to the American\\nmusical remake \"Sweet Charity,\" but will I be laughed out of the room if I\\nwere to say that, in some small ways, I actually prefer \"Charity\" over\\n\"Cabiria\"? To explain exactly why would mean blowing several major plot\\npoints in both movies - suffice it to say that, IMHO, the character played\\nby John McMartin in the remake is an improvement over his Italian\\ncounterpart; his motivations are more complicated and, I think, more\\ncredible.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nIt is almost considered heretic to write something negative about\\nFellini. As a matter of fact, Fellini succeeded to create an ambient of\\nadoration around him like possibly no other film director ever.\\nHowever, all is not gold that glitters.In Fellini\\'s \"Cabiria\" we see some whores of Rome, although they are\\nbitterly poor and misused by their pimps, jumping and dancing in the\\nstreets, merrily laughing, having fun with drinks and food all together\\nenjoying their lives. Even the pimps are there, and if something bad\\nhappens than it is a curse or a smashed car-door, not more. And when\\nthey fight, it is less harmful than amongst children. Even in one of\\nthe last scenes, where an old whore is shown who must live in an\\nearth-cave: she is happy, and as long as the angel provides her with\\nfood, she thanks god that she is allowed to have such a miserable\\nexistence. Fellinis whores have no diseases, and when they suffer, than\\nbecause of loneliness and not from hunger, gonorrhea and bloody limbs.It is hard to believe, yet true, that the screenplay of this movie was\\nwritten by Pier Paolo Pasolini, by the same Pasolini who portrayed the\\nworld of the whores of Romes in a quite different way than Fellini did.\\nIn film theory, one tries to absorb this difference by a notion of\\ntime: Fellini is \"realistic\", Pasolini is \"neo-realistic\". In\\nliterature one would speak about the difference between realism and\\nnaturalism, and in truth one has to speak about the difference between\\nthe blissful stupidity of Fellini who by guarantee never has made a\\nstep down to Ostia and Pasolini who lived there and was killed there.\\nPasolini\\'s \"Mamma Roma\" is not a childish grinning clown-esquire puppet\\nlike Masina\\'s \"Cabiria\" with her school-girlish white socks, but the\\nAcademy Award went to Fellini\\'s wife and not to Anna Magnani. Clearly,\\nFellini who resided on one of the 7 hills of Rome made the money,\\nPasolini was 36 times before court and was poor almost like his friends\\nin Ostia.This is bitterly sad because it is objectively false. One of the main\\nreasons why the big earthquake came in film in the Sixties, called\\n\"Nouvelle Vague\", \"Neue Welle\" of \"New Wage\" is that film makers in\\nwhole Europe were fed up with rose-red lies, conformism, idealistic\\nprosthetics of fascism and other wonderful post-war achievements. In\\nGermany, Fassbinder ended brutally the \"Schulm\\xe4dchen-Report\"- and\\n\"Lederhosen\"-culture. In France, the \"grandfather of Nouvelle Vague\",\\nJean-Pierre Melville, lead the level of the French gangster film up to\\nthat of the best American Film Noirs. And it Italy? In Italy where the\\nfascism was almost more popular after than during World War II,\\nsupported by the Catholic church, Fellini continued his artificial\\nsugar-sweet artistic, astonishingly untouchable by any critique who\\nwanted to make film besides Fellini. Less than 20 years after \"Cabiria\"\\nwas released under his own collaboration, Pasolini knew only one answer\\nto the deplorable and miserable intellectual situation in Italy: his\\ngigantic masterpiece \"Salo\" (1975).\\n',\n",
       " u'*** This review may contain spoilers ***',\n",
       " u'\\nWhile I used to hate the films of Fellini, I have recently seen several\\nmore and re-seen a few and have a greater appreciation for the\\ndirector. In particular, I did not like LA STRADA the first time, but\\nnow think it is a wonderful film and his earlier \"forgotten\" films are\\nexceptional. My particular favorite of all his films is the segment he\\ndid for BOCCACCIO 70--it was very surreal and hilarious. However,\\ndespite my increased appreciation, I STILL don\\'t particularly like Le\\nNOTTI di CABIRIA--though I liked it a little more the second time\\nbecause at least I could see that it was technically well-made.\\nHowever, the story itself of a prostitute who wants to be loved and\\ncared for is unrelentingly awful and depressing--so much so that I\\nnever want to see it again. Part of this might be because I am more a\\nromantic at heart and part of it is that I just feel the film is wildly\\noverrated. Sure, Giulietta Masina did a fine job--she was a fine\\nactress (as well as Fellini\\'s wife), but this doesn\\'t make the movie.\\nThe problem is that the movie is so unrelentingly realistic and grim.\\nSure, in real life prostitutes don\\'t find love and are often\\nabused--but do I really have to see this movie to know this?! The film\\nstarts with Masina getting beaten up and nearly killed by her\\n\"boyfriend\" and the film ends much the same way. Everything else in\\nbetween is leading us to believe that this inevitable ending might not\\noccur, but it does. Now I am not saying I want a vacuous and insipid\\nfilm about a prostitute with a heart of gold--after all, my review for\\nPRETTY WOMAN was savage (I truly, truly hated that movie). But other\\nthan a grim lesson that life sucks, I really can\\'t see why I would\\nrecommend this film. It\\'s good, but not at all pleasant. For people\\nthat can stand all the emotional pain, you may like it a lot more than\\nme--I just want something a little more uplifting and likable.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI fail to understand why a group of people connected with the \"Partito\\nComunista Italiano\" decided to turn the neo-realism into some kind of\\n\"blessed are the idiots, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven\"...To me, Federico Fellini tried to imitate the contemporary \"R\\xe9alisme\\nPo\\xe9tique\" of France, but he had not the dramatic writing powers of say\\n\"Jacques Pr\\xe8vert\". Fellini\\'s approach to the cinema is that a drawer or\\npainter, that\\'s where he started. He had then to find partners to write\\nthe script and found only third class ones.The great writers of WWII times in Italy like Moravia, Caesare Pavese\\nand others were not invited, or refused...Fellini was never an active\\nfighter of Mussolini...The result is that Fellini\\'s movies have no dramatic structure... They\\nare mere vignettes. The musical equivalent is Moussourgski\\'s \"Pictures\\nat an Exhibition\". This became a masterpiece only after Maurice Ravel\\norchestrated it to perfection..In films like \"La Dolce Vita\" and \"Otto et Mezzo\" this lack of dramatic\\nstructure is quite acceptable. In Amarcord, which is my favorite\\nFellini\\'s movie, it is not needed, because it is so close to the truth\\nas a documentary , rings so true and therefore becomes beautiful.But in Cabiria it is badly needed and is missing..When Amedeo Nazzari, in bed, after drinking champagne, prefers to\\nlisten to Beethoven\\'s 5th instead of making love to Cabiria, who he\\ndoes not wish to humiliate, on the contrary, this is the work of guys\\nthat know nothing about whores, women or the meaning of Beethoven\\'s\\n5th.The ending sequence is stupidly pathetic.No wonder that the OIC (Vatican\\'s Movies Office) gave this a prize.Fellini kind of redeemed himself next year in \"La Dolce Vita\" dressing\\nAnita Ekberg as a \"Putana Monsignore\". It was too late..\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI cannot figure out what the other reviewers on this site found here to\\npraise so highly. This film portrays Italians as bickering, violent,\\nselfish dolts. The title character is unsympathetic, irritating, and\\nnasty, and the person portraying her cannot act at all. It is like\\nwatching an eighth grade Italian Kabuki presentation.I have seen and enjoyed many Fellini films. Many have the\\ncharacteristics seen here, but also include some redeeming qualities;\\nfine acting, attractive people, an engaging story. Not this turkey.\\nCabiria would have done better to have drowned, as was threatened in\\nthe opening scene. Of course she was saved (or there would be no movie)\\nand promptly chews out her rescuers. Just because a film is European, black & white, and done on the cheap\\ndoes not make it art.I am so glad I rented this instead of buying it or paying to see it in\\nthe theater. But, after playing it, I felt like I needed to clean my\\nliving room! Absolute dreck! Avoid it like a plague.\\n',\n",

And I was told the movie lasted close to 4(!)\\nhours...\\nI figured this would be a complete waste of time...\\nBOY was I wrong! This movie is completely the opposite!\\nIt is just amazing!\\nMr. Gowariker has selected an incredible cast with Aamir Khan in the lead.\\nHe makes an stunning performance as the village rebel, Bhuvan.

This means\\nthat\\nmost of the harvest surplus is gone and there is just enough left for food\\nfor the farmers themselves. It\\'s a classic war between \"David\", the\\nnative\\nvillagers of India, and \"Goliath\", the powerful and greedy Britons. But\\nwhat makes it really interesting is that this war is fought in a Cricket\\narena.\\nThis is a challenge from the Britons, who are well known with Cricket,\\nagainst the village, where most people have never laid eyes upon a cricket\\nbat.\\nIf the villagers win, there will be no lagaan at all, for three\\nyears!\\nAnd if the Britons win, they will collect triple lagaan, which will mean\\nthe end of the village.  The stakes could not be higher!!I can\\'t remember a movie being this thrilling and having so much life in it.\\nAnd the music has a huge impact thanks to the great voices of Udit\\nNarayan,\\nLata Mangeshkar etc. And the dancing is a chapter in itself!\\nFew or none will leave this movie not remembering the song \"Mitwa, sun\\nMitwa\".\\nIt is a must see for everyone, inside and outside of India.\\nAnd this movies has been totally righteously nominated for an Oscar too, and\\nI\\nwouldn\\'t be surprised if it goes all the way to the top.

       " u\"\\nIn 1893, India was a colony of England. The starving native farmers had\\nto pay an imposed tax to the British soldiers for the protection of\\ntheir lands, delivering most of their harvest to the British Queen. In\\nthose years, the lands were very dry due to the lack of rain, and the\\ninhabitants of Champaner decide to request to their Rajah Puran Singh\\n(Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to waive the taxes. While waiting for the Rajah,\\nBhuvan (Aamir Khan), the beloved friend of Gauri (Gracy Singh),\\ncomments that the silly game of cricket was a stupid game, comparable\\nto the Indian child game 'gilli-danda'. The nasty and arrogant Captain\\nAndrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), who had had a previous discussion\\nwith Bhuvan, listens to his comment and challenges Bhuvan to play a\\nmatch against the British team, imposing the following condition: if\\nthe natives win the game, they would not need to pay Lagaan for the\\nnext three years. Otherwise, they would triplicate their payment in\\nthat year. Bhuvan accepts the bet despite of the opinion of his people.\\nThe sister of Captain Russell, Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley),\\nfinds the competition unfair to the Indians and decides to help Bhuvan\\nand his friends, teaching them how to play cricket. This movie is a magnificent and overwhelming fairytale. It really\\ndeserved an Oscar nomination! The nice and well-directed story has\\nwonderful songs and interpretations, romance, treason, dispute, drama,\\nbeautiful messages, outstanding choreography, being a stunning film\\nindicated as family entertainment. The expensive Brazilian DVD is a\\nshame, showing a total lack of respect of the 'Columbia Tristar Home\\nVideo' with the Brazilian costumers: the important songs do not have\\nsubtitles in Portuguese. I changed the option in the 'Menu' to\\n'English', and there were subtitles in English. At least in the opinion\\nof the ridiculous Columbia representatives, Brazilians shall learn\\nEnglish first to understand the wonderful lyrics sang in Hindi. I feel\\nreally sorry for those who cannot understand English, since they will\\nmiss the meaning of these songs. It is amazing how 225 minutes running\\ntime passes so fast when you see such a marvelous movie. My vote is\\nten.Title (Brazil): 'Lagaan \\x96 A Coragem de Um Povo' ('Lagaan \\x96 The Courage\\nof a People')\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThis  movie not only opened my eyes to the beatuies of india but also the\\nhearts of India. I fell in love with this movie at once and I feel very\\nclose to all of the characters I know them and feel for them.

       " u\"\\n\\nSony Entertainment's Lagaan is more an experience than a\\nmovie.Indian actor Aamir Khan's home production is a cinematic experience which\\nhighlights Indian cinema to the hilt, while weaving a tale set in Champaner\\nduring the time of the British Empire's presence which deals with Lagaan\\n(the tax of the land) and a village's upheaval against its\\noppressors.The film revolves mainly around three characters namely Bhuvan (Aamir\\nKhan),\\nGauri (debutante Gracey Singh) and Elizabeth (British actress Rachel\\nShelley), and deals with Bhuvan's spirited fight to defend what is his\\nbirthright, as he embroils the entire village into a magnitude of problems\\nwhich inadvertently ends up being their only escape from the tyranny under\\nwhich they reside. Gauri is the simple village girl who loyally stands\\nbehind the man she loves yet cannot profess her love to, while Elizabeth is\\nthe beautiful sister of the British Lieutenant and the complication who\\naids\\nthe village in their fight against injustice.The first half sets the scene beautifully, explaining what Lagaan is,\\nintroducing the characters and gradually pulling the audience into this\\nperiod and place, literally taking the viewer into Champaner through\\ncinematography which highlights the locales and sets which establish the\\nstandard of living. It makes you feel for the characters, believe in the\\nvillagers and draws you into the celluloid created world, while the second\\npresents to you their turmoil, dawns on you what is at stake and whisks you\\naway in a tornado of emotions and rising spirits.The opening scenes are more congruent to joining a conversation midway, as\\nfrom the moment you are thrust into 1893's India, you gain footing and a\\nsense of atmosphere, feeling at ease as the camera pans across its setting\\nfor the movie, drifting into the journey that will hold your attention for\\nthe duration of the film. Apart from familiarising the viewer with its\\ncharacters, the first half also takes you back with its breathtakingly\\nbeautiful cinematography and fitting background score. The characters are\\nestablished, the situation presented and relationships etched, with each\\nscene rhythmically flowing from one to the other in a continuos\\nmotion.The second half is less involved in justifying its characters and aims more\\ntowards culminating the scene which has been set in the first. By this time\\nyou are already a part of this world and your emotions have already been\\nstirred, now they are put to the test as the events which will determine\\nthe\\nentire crux of the film begin and get the viewer involved.The romantic triangle between Bhuvan, Gauri and Elizabeth is expertly\\nhandled. The beauty of its predicament is that no one feels a loss by the\\nend of the film, and director Ashutosh Gowariker beautifully justifies\\neternal love (but not necessarily requitted love) through drawing a\\ncomparison with the spiritual romance of the Hindu god Krishna and Radha. A\\ndelightfully delicately handled scene and situation gives birth to the\\nfoundation which will resolve the triangle in a manner leaving warmth in\\nthe\\nviewer's heart.Aamir Khan is a revelation. His acting is superb and be it the conviction\\nand fire in his eyes, the way he draws breaths from the air of the abode he\\ncalls home or even gulps at the atrocities he witnesses, he has become\\nBhuvan completely. His portrayal is such that it puts you inside Bhuvan's\\npsyche and enables the viewer to understand the character from his\\ndemeanour\\nalone. His piercing eyes stare sharply like razor blades, cutting through\\nthe camera and leave a haunting impression on an unsuspecting audience,\\ndrawing them more and more deeper into his world.Gracey Singh performs ably and is also an extremely graceful dancer, as\\nparticularly evident in the Radha Kaise Na Jale song. She acts with her\\neyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, all of her and gives to the role of Gauri\\ncompletely, giving a debut performance of high calibre.Rachel Shelley makes her presence felt like an ethereal spirit. Apart from\\nlooking stunning she adds to whichever frame she is in with panache and\\nstyle. Her crossover to Indian cinema, or indeed to this film, is\\ndelicately\\nhandled and a feat to be applauded. To light a face like Shelley's in the\\nsame frame as the villagers without making one or the other look\\nconsiderably darker or awkwardly paler, is a difficult task in itself. But\\nthe cinematography, the lighting and make up is such that the characters\\ncome alive as physical presences which complement each other, as do Aamir\\nKhan and Rachel Shelley. Her interactions with Bhuvan and the villagers are\\nintricately handled and executed wonderfully, and her inclusion in the O\\nRey\\nChori song is poetry on screen. To make a Western character dance in Indian\\ncinema without causing a giggle from the audience or without it appearing\\nunnatural is also something which needs to be handled with careful thought\\nand the result is such that this song picturisation alone will invoke\\ndiscussion on how beautifully it has been shot.Andrew Russell's boisterous character is brought to life by Paul\\nBlackthorne, as he slides perfectly under the skin of a character that\\nshould reflect British pride and be menacing and hostile. He performs well\\nand bounces off the supporting cast with utmost ease. The entire ensemble\\nof\\nsupporting cast are deserved of mention, and particularly Raghuveer Yadav,\\nwho dynamically brings the character of Bhura across effectively and\\nconvincingly with edge.A R Rahman is the composer who has scored for many Indian and South Indian\\nfilms, and this time too he does not betray his reputation of being a\\nmodern\\nday Mozart. He literally teases then grabs you with his music, first\\nresonating your veins, then breaths and finally allowing it to explode and\\nburst through your body like an energy force, flowing in sync with your\\nheartbeat. It's lilting melody, fresh sound and courageous allegros\\nmesmerise and reflect the movie's emotions and spirit of hope. The songs\\nare\\nvery well picturised and choreography is excellent, particularly Ghanan\\nGhanan, O Mitwa and O Rey Chori. The bhajan O Paalanhaare is bewitchingly\\nlit and shot, injecting a spiritual vibe as candles' flickering flames\\nhypnotise every viewer whose eyes dance to its command.The film belongs to Aamir and Ashutosh Gowariker all the way. Direction is\\nsuperb and results in what is a true mark on Indian cinema, held together\\nby\\nAamir's awe-inspiring performance.Lagaan is about hope, courage, fighting against injustice, the human spirit\\nand about Indians. You enter the cinema to be entertained, and leave with a\\npiece of cinematic history being firmly etched in your\\nheart.Fuad Omar.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nThis was my first full-fledged trip into Bollywood and I couldn\\'t have\\nasked for a better entry. While there were some inconsistencies in\\nsound, overall I loved the picture. Some of the songs and dances were\\nbreathtaking and emotionally charged. In particular the number where\\nBhuvan and the young boy are sitting on a hill and they\\'re shrugging\\ntheir shoulders, soon getting the village into the act. The other\\nnumber where Bhuvan and Gauri re-enact the love of Krishna and Radha in\\nexquisite dancing. Also there were many moments of stunning,\\nbreathtaking images, including the women of the village seated in the\\ntemple praying for salvation. Absolutely stunning. While I feel some judicious pruning could have trimmed the nearly 4\\nhour long version I watched (the DVD of which included an additional 17\\nminutes cut from this version) the picture did not seem nearly as long\\nas it really was. Aamir Khan is such an instantly likable presence and Gracy Singh is\\nsimply irresistible as Gauri. Paul Blackthorne was a hilarious, old-school villain right out of a\\npenny dreadful melodrama \\x96 and I mean this as a compliment. Rachel Shelley\\'s Elizabeth was a perfect blend of Victorian reserved\\nbeauty and free spirit and noble in her heartbreak. So many other performances ran the gamut from old school \"b\"\\nstereotypical characters to some original ideas.The blending of melodrama (in its purest sense) true comedic moments\\n(the hen keeper), self and enlightenment culminated in the scene where\\nBhuvan shocks the village by touching an untouchable; his stirring,\\nheartfelt speech about brotherhood and putting away castes shaming the\\nvillage into enlightenment.Some of the criticism leveled at Lagaan is (I believe) unduly harsh.\\nThis is a charming movie and a perfect introduction into the joys of\\nBollywood.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nLAGAAN (4+ outta 5 stars) Years of subjugation and unfair taxation by\\nthe British Empire come to a head and the inhabitants of a small Indian\\nfarming community face off against their evil oppressors... in a\\ncricket match??? This may seem like a ridiculous idea for a movie (and\\nI won't even mention the fact that it's a musical) but this was the\\nmost exciting and wonderful movie I've seen in quite some time. Yes, it\\nall comes down to a cricket match between the upper class British twits\\nand the neophyte Indian farmers... and the movie is almost FOUR HOURS\\nlong... but, wow... what a movie this is! The slow building of trust\\nand community among the usually-bickering villagers as they prepare for\\ntheir ultimate battle is both fascinating and inspiring. It's like\\nwatching The Magnificent Seven or The Wild Bunch gathering together for\\na big showdown... only instead of shooting and killing... there's\\ncricket! A cocky British Captain (Paul Blackthorne) makes a deal with\\nthe proud, young Bhuvan (Aamir Khan): he will give the entire region\\nthree years of no taxes if they can defeat the British cricket team...\\nbut if they lose they have to pay triple tax this year. Since there has\\nbeen no rain all season and they can't even pay their regular taxes...\\nthis becomes a tense, do-or-die situation. Aamir Khan is terrific in\\nthe lead (he resembles a cross between Tony Curtis, Peter Sellers and\\nAl Pacino). He is always believable, whether trying to inspire his\\nfellow villagers or facing his English enemies in stony silence or\\nwooing his the lovely Gauri (Gracy Singh) with song and dance. Great\\nstory! Great music! Don't miss this one!\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\n\\nI initially gave this movie a miss after I was totally disappointed by\\n\"Asoka\". The latter was hugely advertised but I don\\'t find it good at\\nall.I finally saw \"Lagaan\" after a friend told me that this movie was actually\\ngood. And she was right. I borrowed the DVD from the library and had to see\\nthe movie in 2 sessions due to it\\'s almost 4-hour-long running time. But it\\nwas worth it!The cricket game was captivating. I didn\\'t know anything about cricket but\\nbefore the movie ended, I felt that I almost understand the\\ngame!I\\'m not Indian and I seldom see Indian movie even though I love foreign\\nmovies, especially Japanese. But \"Lagaan\" is truly the best Indian movie\\nI\\'ve ever seen, or at least the best of the year 2001.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nInitially I was warned about the length of the movie-3hrs and 50 mins.But\\nbelieve me, its worth it.There is a refreshing Indian-ness about the\\nmovie,which is welcome after a recent bout of Hollywood remakes in Hindi\\nthat have become such an eye-sore.The emotion that Indians share about cricket is effectively taken advantage\\nof(the cricket match played between villagers of Champaner and the British\\nofficers which forms the climax ,extends to about an hour and a\\nhalf).The best part of the movie is the characterization of the eleven players\\n(villagers).Aamir Khan is at his best in this movie and Gracie Singh lives\\nthe role of Gauri.The acting talents of the British actors esp. that of the\\nofficer Captain Russel(played by Paul Blackthorne) is notable.There was never a boring moment in the film, the dialogues and songs'\\nlyrics\\nare very meaningful.And lastly I must appreciate the work behind the entire\\ncricket sequence as it covers most of the aspects of the game and not to\\nmention - match fixing,sledging,body line bowling ,making it gripping till\\nthe last ball! A must see for Indian cricket fans!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is actually the first ever film I have seen where the audience\\nclapped cheered and booed effectively as if they were a part of the\\nactual proceedings in the film. I heard someone say that they felt that\\nthey were really at a cricket match. I loved the movie even though\\nadmittedly at the time (surprising for an Indian) I didn't know cricket\\nat all...I learned while watching it with the help of a friend but also\\nfound I didn't need to! It certainly renewed my interest and made mea\\ncricket fan soon enough, the next match that year I watched with grave\\ninterest.About the fikm, the acting was good. Rachel Shelly and Paul Blackthorne\\nwere impressive and unlike in other Hindi films where they are usually\\nclich\\xe9d versions of foreign characters, they were very drawn out\\nbelievable characters. Aamir Khan was definitely the star attraction\\n(obviously) as in any case it was 'his movie' but honestly he was very\\ngood, one of hsi best performances i'd personally say. Gauri was given\\nvery little to do in the movie but she did stand out in her own way.\\nThe supporting cast were all excellent in each of their roles, although\\nsome characters were a bit too starkly depicted. The British cast on\\nthe other hand had precious little to do except look foreboding.The setting in the Gujrati village and country was beautiful. The sets\\nwere historically accurate I've been told and the backdrop just right\\nfor the match and one would it imagine it fit into the time frame\\nsuggested. The costumes were also appropriate. I especially liked that\\nscene where Elisabeth imagines Aamir in a suit, it worked because being\\nwho she is of course shed see him like that.)Some historians might\\nnitpick on small points, but they were so minor that the rest of the\\nstory overshadowed these errors. At first I wondered whether foreign viewers would understand it what\\nthe unusual concept of musical numbers, but most seem to have\\nunderstood the game of cricket (non cricket playing countries I mean)\\nand the historical context as well and seem to have also taken the\\nmusical numbers in their stride.The only thing that got to me was the length of the movie. I really\\nwish that they had done some serious editing, it just ran too long and\\nthe cricket match was too dragged out. It should have either focused\\nmore on the cricket match for the majority of the film, or reduced the\\nfootage of the rest of the film to balance it out. I saw many scenes\\nthat could have been edited out and were totally unnecessary.The songs were enjoyable and only one or two were unnecessary and could\\nhave been cut down or deleted entirely, like the 'Radha Kaise Na Jale'\\nand the song where both girls sing. Honestly this movie was one Hindi\\nmovie that did not require many songs at all if at all. A background\\nscore maybe but not 6 songs. It got tedious and it gets on the nerves\\nespecially when you've been sitting in the theatre for 2 hours and you\\nknow that there is 1 more hour to go. Luckily people with DVDs will be\\nable to fast forward!Although Predictable in places with characters being over-drawn or\\nunder-drawn and everyone knew the ending that was inevitable, ending,\\n(it isn't much of a long shot at all) but we watched it for the thrill\\nof it anyway.The overall effect the movie was so good that I fully believe that it\\ndeserved a nomination and I never say that about most Hindi movies.\\nEven though it did not win I'm very proud of this movie.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\n1893.  In a small farming community in India stands a British cantonment\\ncommanded by the cruel Captain Russell.  When the Raja refuses to bow to his\\ndemands to eat meat he doubles the tax that the community must pay \\x96 even\\nthough the lack of rain means the community can barely pay the normal rate. \\nWhen the villagers beg for mercy Russell challenges them to a cricket match\\n\\x96 to win means the tax is waived, to lose means it is trebled.  One man in\\nthe village, Bhuvan takes up the bet and must rally the village to learn the\\ngame and win at all costs.I was given this to watch because I had told someone at work that Bollywood\\nmovies are essentially a love story where the parents disapprove but it all\\ngets sorted in a big dance number.  So she gave me this to widen my\\nknowledge.  At first read of the plot I thought to myself `this is \\x91the air\\nup there' with cricket' \\x96 then I saw the 3\\xbd hour running time!  But I said\\nI'd watch it out of courtesy.However let me tell you that the time flew by really quickly.  It only\\ndragged occasionally but for most of the time I was really entertained by\\nthe plot and in some cases gripped by the drama.  First of all \\x96 I'm not a\\nfan of cricket but this could really be any sport as that is not important\\nto the story.  The plot may be the old `underdog' chestnut but it is still\\nvery well done with lots of energy and lots of nice touches that take the\\nchestnut and add just enough difference to it to make it seem\\nfresh.This main plot also has various stories underneath.  The main one being the\\nromance between Bhuvan and Gauri which is complicated by the arrival of\\nElizabeth, who also falls for Bhuvan.  This is well handled and is very\\ninvolving \\x96 although I don't really like Bollywood song and dance numbers\\nvery much, so these slowed proceedings a little for me.  Although many of\\nthe songs are comic but also very well choreographed.The film is really helped by the constant interweaving of comedy in the form\\nof the villagers' characters \\x96 they fight, they fall down they argue etc \\x96\\nbut it is still amusing if not roaringly funny.  However the focus on their\\nplight is never lost \\x96 the drama is kept running just below the surface at\\nall times and the final hour is tense.  Tense!  A cricket match!  I didn't\\nexpect it to be exciting but at times you are on the edge of your seat \\x96 and\\nit isn't as cliched a game as I'd expected it to be!It does have some flaws of course \\x96 the film is a little heavy handed at\\nfirst in making sure we know the British are bad, it is done too early and\\ntoo quickly \\x96 couldn't we have been led to that conclusion rather than\\npushed straight away?  The songs I found to sound very similar to oneanother\\n\\x96 but this may be the fact I don't like them.  To add to this the sound\\nquality between the songs and the dialogue was very different \\x96 the songs\\nall had a very studio feel when heard beside the dialogue.  Also the plot is\\na little cliched \\x96 although I after watching it I did think that it was well\\ndone and like I said, had nice touches (which I won't tell) that upped the\\ndrama \\x96 even if you THINK you know how it'll end.But over an almost 4 hr running time, minor flaws can be forgiven.  Khan is\\na good Bollywood lead but the film helps him by not making him invincible \\x96\\nrather it does show him making mistakes etc.  Singh is good as Gauri even if\\nshe is a standard `wide eyes' Bollywood starlet!  Surprisingly good was\\n`Holby City' actor Paul Blackthorne who not only manages to give a really\\nmean performance but does it in both Hindi and English.  He also looks a bit\\nlike Sean Connery \\x96 or at least he did to me!Overall this manages to make the long running time fly by quite easily \\x96 a\\nrare feat for a movie these days.  It is exciting, romantic and comic.  It\\nmay have it's flaws but on the whole it is a very entertaining film in many\\nways.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nIt is seldom in this modern era of IT generation that a long movie\\nsurpassing three hours of running time and without a show of synthetic\\nacting, vulgarity and cheap comedy, captivates the audience to stick to\\ntheir seats. WELL DONE Gowarikar ...... WELL DONE Amir Khan ....... Mr. Gowarikar, please note that if this sublime film had been directed\\nby a British or American director like Danny Boyle or Richard\\nAttenborough .... the Oscars would have definitely flown into the laps\\nof the director and the protagonist actor. This is not to say that your\\ndirectorial skills lack the excellence to win the coveted Academy\\nAwards, but it is to mention the inherent bias and prejudice which\\nprevails among the jury of the Oscar Award Committee towards directors,\\nproducers and actors of the Sub-Continent namely India. Mother India\\n(1957) met the same fate from the then jury of Academy Awards committee\\nwho simply rejected its nomination for the Oscars on the grounds that\\nit is laden with too much songs, formulaic in nature. Besides, the excellent performance of Amir Khan as an aggressive and\\nchallenging native youth 'Bhavan'; Rachael Shelley has put up a\\nremarkable and evocatively strong performance as the suave young\\nBritish lady Elizabeth Russell, who aspires to help out the hapless\\nvillagers from the cunning guile of his brother, Captain Russel. Now what can one say if the members of the Oscar awarding committee do\\nnot understand the meanings of wordings of the emotionally focused\\nsongs (due to language and culture difference). It is a handicap with\\nthem and not with the local Indian movie making team. Keeping aside this injustice, the movie characterizes pure and pristine\\nfeelings, emotions, struggle and fighting spirit of a raw and unskilled\\ncricket team of illiterate Indian villagers who capitalized the\\nopportunity to get waived the odious land revenue tax, with exacting\\nstandards of will power and perseverance.After a long time, there is an Indian movie bred with the contents\\nfound in the Indian films of yester years.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nYou can add the name of Ashutosh Gowatrikar to the list of the new\\ngeneration of Indian Film Directors. An amazing list with the likes of\\nAditya Chopra (Mohabbatein, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge), Farhan Akhtar\\n(Dil Chahta Hai, Lakshya), Karan Johar (Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kuch\\nKuch Hota Hai), Sooraj Barjatya (Maine Pyar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun,\\nHum Saath Saath Hain), Sanjay Leela Bhansali (Khamoshi, Hum Dil De\\nChuke Sanam). And Now Ashutosh Gowatrikar (Lagaan).When I went to see Lagaan in the theater, I had certain expectations of\\nwhat the story was going to be like. But as I watched the film I\\nrealized that it was nothing like what I thought. The story was totally\\nunexpected. It was quite a surprise. Never before has a film done that,\\nusually the trailers, promos or songs of an Indian film give the story\\naway and you get an idea of what the film is going to be like, but\\nLagaan was a total surprise.The story is very well told and each character is well etched. Aamir\\nKhan gives one of his best performances in the film. New find Gracy\\nSingh gives an excellent performance. The Direction and Story of\\nAshutosh Gowatrikar are beyond words. After watching the film, it is\\nvery easy to see why this film was sent to the Oscars for the Best\\nForeign Film category.A great movie, definitely worth watching at least 10 or 12 times.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nMagnificent, what else shall I say? I first saw this movie in a\\nTV/DVD/CD/electricals/computer, etc shop. The movie was on one of the\\nTV for sale, only on to demonstrate the quality of image of the said\\nTV. I walked in front and saw a group of people watching. Some of them\\nhad even sat down on the floor. I stopped too and was captivated. I\\nstayed till the end and left the shop with the DVD.Like many Bollywood movies, this one can appear strange to the western\\nmovie-goers. We find it hard to understand the music and dances that\\nseem to come out of the blue, a lot of details are also entirely up to\\nBollywood tradition, a tradition that we just don't know well enough.But what can at first appear as flaws can either be explained by\\ntradition or in the case of this movie completely forgiven due to\\nbeauty of it. Yes Gauri is a bit childish, Bhuvan is just too nice, the\\nEnglish captain too evil and the ending just had to be a goodies take\\nall, baddies run away type. Yes, it can seem simple and and\\nsuperficial. Due to their exceptionnally uncomplicated roles, the\\nEnglish actors are not brilliant. Being 100% evil or 100% nice never\\nmakes one look like a good actor. But does all that makes this movie\\nany less magnificent? No. The story is just wonderful, the colours, the\\ndances, the songs, and the genuine innocence of the characters which\\nmake you care for them and really make you want them to win.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is one of the best entertainers from Bollywood. It has a moving\\nstory, excellent music, amazing performances and great dances. All the\\ningredients are perfectly balanced, resulting in a true masterpiece.To the detractors of this movie(esp the American ones). Granted, on the\\naverage, your Hollywood movies are way better than bollywood ones. But\\nyour best movies are not even close to the good ones of Bollywood. The\\nreason you may not be able to appreciate good movies like this is that\\nin the US, your life is one dimensional and you don't have the\\ndifferent experiences that people who grow up in India have. For you\\nguys (americans), the world starts from California on the west and ends\\nat NY on the east. Movies are to be enjoyed and not analyzed. If you are of the thinking\\ntype, there are lot of other things which you can analyze (proof of\\nFermat's last theorem for example). Don't apply your analytical skills\\nto movies.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nI saw this in a Paris cinema on a Sunday afternoon. The French audience\\nloved it, as did I. They clapped at the intermission and they clapped to\\nthe\\nmusic while the credits were running. I thought the song and dance\\nroutines\\nwere great, providing the perfect bridge to a semi-mythologised\\nnarrative.\\nThe audience sometimes laughed at the exaggeration and coincidence of\\nthe\\nplot, especially at the end -- the rain, the Englishwoman who never\\nmarried.\\nAstonishingly they even got the joke about 'this country will be the\\nfuture\\nof this game'. It seems that lack of knowledge of cricket and subtitles\\nwith\\nwords like 'runs', 'overs' and 'no ball' were not a handicap. Of course\\nthe\\npillorying of the British didn't go down badly here. I especially liked\\nthe\\nrepresentation of the Raj, not as a moderrnising influence, but as\\nstraight\\nagrarian civilisation, extraction of the food from peasants'\\nmouths.I was on the edge of tears throughout. Why? Because this was the first\\nIndian production that to my knowledge has won a world audience. And it\\nprovided a new sentimental bridge to the world for my own trajectory. I\\ncould see how Bollywood is the only film-making centre that actually\\ncould\\ndo what Hollywood does, but in its own distinctive way, with a much more\\nuniversal human interest. And the music of course. The plot and\\ncharacters\\nwere caricatured, but that made it all that more accessible and\\ntouching,\\nlike a medieval passion play. I loved the symbolic roles contrived for\\nthe\\nMuslim, the Untouchable, the Sikh, the collaborator, the headman, the\\nintellectual etc.Above all, the plot of learning the game and beating the masters was\\nperfect. It was CLR James to the tee. Beyond a Boundary indeed , with\\nsociety in the shape of the crowd as much of the action as the players.\\nAnd\\nthe idea of the bet! Play comes from an Old English word whose first\\nmeaning\\nis to wager. The idea of life as a game of negotiated risks is very\\nwidespread among hunter-gatherers, where people have to be trained to\\nrespond instantly to the flash of white tail in the bush. Obviously it\\nsometimes pays for peasants (and citydwellers) to pick up these skills.\\nThe\\nplay goes on.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nIt's my sixth Bollywood film, and I have fallen in love with this one\\nas much as with the others. It's not as warm and colorful as K3G or as\\nfunny as Main Hoon Na, but the story is so involving that I spent\\nalmost four hours anxiously following the main characters' efforts to\\nwin the game. I almost started to bite my nails at the end, keeping\\nthumbs up for Bhuvan and his friends! The strength of the film lies in\\nthe fact that it shows how important cooperation, faith and effort are\\nif you want to achieve something in your life. And although I, as a\\nPole, have no idea whatsoever about the rules of the game of cricket, I\\nwas not bored for a second during the second part of the movie - thanks\\nto the director's ability to introduce tension at the right moments. I\\nliked the songs a lot and I think they've been nicely choreographed.\\nThe camera work is good, emphasizing the dryness of the land and the\\nhopelessness of the people anxiously waiting for the rain.

I figured I would\\nwatch a few minutes and then lay down for my well needed rest. Well,\\nalmost 4 hours later, I'm looking up the movie on IMDb.I don't understand the game of cricket at all and, honestly, could care\\nless. I was captivated by the characters and their plight. I was\\nrooting for the underdog The songs were so touching and spiritual. The\\ndance scenes, especially the love dance one, were beautiful.I have read many comments on here that the movie was badly lip sang. I\\ndisagree. Until I read it here I hadn't noticed it at all.Overall, I cheered, I laughed at a few of the zanier characters, and I\\nalso found myself streaming tears for the young boy. I found myself\\nexperiencing the same emotions the English woman was showing during the\\ngame.I think they tied everything together well in the end. I ended the\\nmovie feeling like I wanted to recommend it to others.So see the movie!! OK. I am finally off to bed.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThe movie is nice but a little boring because of its runtime is three\\nhours and some and it tires until the person most patient. The yarn\\nconcerns about inhabitants of a village whose leader (Aamir Khan got\\nhis ears pierced so that he could actually wear earrings) asks the\\nEnglish deputies for the exemption a tax called Lagaan . Officer at\\ncommand (Paul Blackthorne) will free them for three years if they earn\\na cricket match . The officer's sister (Rachel Shelley) will teach them\\nto play cricket game .The film has an excellent musical scenario , the choreography is\\nfantastic , the songs are enjoyable . The movie was shot in villages of\\nBhuj (Gujarat); Bhuj was destroyed in an earthquake on 26th January\\n2001, six months after the movie was shot . The first Bollywood\\nproduction to use synchronized sound , most Indian films are dubbed\\nentirely in the studio in the process . Bollywood has got a lot of\\nexperience in this kind of movies . The Bollywood center is located in\\nBombay , where has been shot hundreds of films .The flick mingles comedy , songs, music , cricket sport, a love story ,\\njoy and a lot of fun . The movie is an India/British production though\\nmostly produced by the first country and specially by the main starring\\n: Aamir Khan , a true idol in India with millions of fans. The film\\nwill appeal to the musical genre buffs and cricket lovers. Rating:\\n6'5/10 good . Better than average , well worth watching.\\n\",\n",

It's a tribute to the\\nmovie's appeal, the actors' talent and the movie-maker's storytelling\\nskills. Another wonderful thing about the movie is that the mysterious\\nsport called cricket becomes clearer to the puzzled Filipino. I may\\nhave one minor complaint, the musical numbers are full of energy and\\nenthusiasm, but when the British Lady sings it becomes a parody of a\\nWestern musical.

I heartily\\nrecommend it to anyone curious about Hindi films.Aamir Khan's attention to detail is fantastic, as is his energetic\\nportrayal of a young man fed up with the status quo and willing to risk\\nall for a chance to cast the burdensome yoke of British taxation off\\nhis village. Revolution without significant bloodshed, beautiful\\ncinematography and choreography, excellent costuming, an intriguing\\nlove triangle, and a captivating story line ... all this and an\\nedge-of-your-seat cricket match!

       " u\"\\nHaving won multiple awards and gotten itself nominated in the 2002\\nAcademy Awards in the Best Foreign Language Film category, my interest\\nin Lagaan was actually in wanting to discover more of writer-director\\nAshutosh Gowariker's works, having seen his latest movie Jodha Akbar,\\nand having bought Swades: We, the People starring Shah Rukh Khan, still\\nunwatched.I've never been a fan of cricket and have never understood the rules,\\nbut I suppose after the time you're through with Lagaan, you'll learn\\nat least the basics enough to enjoy the game. No doubt my interest in\\nthis sport has been piqued, and non-fans shouldn't steer away from the\\nmovie, because knowledge of the sport is not a pre-requisite for you to\\nenjoy this wonderful gem of a sports movie running close to a whopping\\n3.5 hours (and I heard in the collector's edition, it runs to 4?)Set in British India, we learn that Lagaan is a form of taxation that\\nthe villagers have to pay to their Rajas, who in turn pay the British\\nfor protection against, erm, invading forces and rivals from other\\nRajas. In fact, the British were double crossing everyone during their\\noccupation of the country, and bad weather makes the lives of the\\nvillagers even more hard pressed since they have zero crops to sell.\\nEvery village needs a folk hero, and herein lies Bhuvan (Aamir Khan)\\nwho decides to step into the shoes of one, not because of bravado, but\\nbecause of the atrocities dished out by the British against his fellow\\ncountrymen, especially when taxes for the year have been doubled.So the stakes are raised in a game of cricket. Defeat the British, led\\nby Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne) and have a tax waver of 3\\nyears for the entire province, or if they lose, then their Lagaan will\\nbe tripled. And you don't need a rocket scientist to tell you that when\\nthe impoverished have their backs against the corner, they have little\\nchoice but to fight back. However, after years of being oppressed and\\ncowering in the face of hardship, you'll need that bright spark or two\\nto shake things up and bring everyone to their senses that Hope is\\nsomething they have which they can turn into reality if they work at\\nit.The storyline might seem clich\\xe9 as per the usual sports movies, where\\nour hero Bhuvan has to assemble a team of good men each with their own\\nspecial farming background which can be incorporated into the game, and\\nrecruitment always is a challenge when nobody believes you, and thinks\\nyou're the troublemaker who started it all. There are leaders, and\\nthere are followers, and some good time is invested to develop this\\nchallenge, as well as to explore the plight of the villagers in more\\ndetail. The villains of the movie, those pompous Brits personified by\\nCaptain Russell with his nose perpetually in the air all the time, are\\nput in very bad light with their looking down of the natives as slaves.But even amongst themselves, the Indians too have their infamous caste\\nsystem, and this was touched upon when Bhuvan chooses to adopt the more\\nmeritocratic route in player selection, and this message undoubtedly\\nstands out. I can't comment much on these themes that Gowariker touch\\nupon in his films, such as that of religious tolerance in Jodha Akbar,\\nbut it seems likely that he had incorporated these knowing that his\\nfilms do appeal to the masses, and therefore serve as a reminder to\\neveryone.While the last 1.5 hours get devoted to the game, where two proud man\\ngo head to head against each other with their team, and team members\\nhaving their own personal vendettas worked out during the matches, it\\nnever for a minute played out in a boring manner. In fact, it was\\nentertaining to watch them go through the paces of the game in 101\\nterms, and from there, those unfamiliar with cricket will likely be\\nable to pick up the basics. Even if the sport is not your cup of tea,\\nits delivery will still appeal to you, as do the usual Bollywood staple\\nof dance and song, as composed by renowned A.R. Rahman - I particularly\\nliked the segment where any self-respective sports movie will have -\\nthe training montage, and with a love triangle of sorts fused between\\nBhuvan, his childhood sweetheart Gauri (Gracy Singh) and Englishwoman\\nElizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), sister of the villagers' enemy but\\none who decides to teach them the game so that they can get on equal\\nterms with her countrymen.Despite its clich\\xe9s, Lagaan is wonderful entertainment, and you will\\nnot realize the movie's running length, as you'll be engrossed in what\\ntranspires, and will find yourself rooting for the clear underdogs as\\nthey go about trying to battle oppression in unfamiliar terms.\\nColourful songs and charismatic folk characters, Lagaan unquestionably\\nreinforces my love for Bollywood!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nI'm not an Indian myself, I'm a Filipina and this is actually the first\\nIndian film I've ever seen but I was automatically enthralled as the\\nfilm starts playing\\x85I have to admit I became engrossed with the film\\nalready when the first scenes was where Aamir Khan was. Later on, as\\nGracie Singh performs superbly with all the musical performances, I\\ndecided from then on that I already love this movie! Even though I only\\nhave to watch thru the subtitles, it's certainly fine with me. This\\nfilm was only introduced to me by my cousins during Christmas last\\nyear. From then on, I've looked everywhere for this movie in every\\nvideo stores. Luckily, I got one 2weeks ago and I became so fascinated\\nthat I download pictures & wallpapers already\\x85all about Lagaan!!! I\\nwouldn't be posting a comment here if I didn't have the Lagaan fever!!!\\n=p The story started in a small village of Champaner , where Bhuvan\\n(Aamir Khan) and Gauri (Gracie Singh) are in a community of poor and\\ninnocent farmers who are happily plowing, sowing, praying for the rains\\nand reaping their harvest. Inspite of such unwanted circumstances, they\\nare still full of hope.But then, a British captain, Captain Andrew (Paul Blackthorne),\\nchallenges the farmers to a cricket match. He is a capricious character\\nthat wants to burden the villagers with a land tax (Lagaan). He waived\\nthat there'll be no Lagaan for the next three years and that he'll be\\nthe one to pay it from his own pocket. Worst, if they lose, they will\\npay triple Lagaan for that year. He knows that the villagers are\\nignorant of the game and its rules. So he's pretty confident that he'll\\nwin the game\\x85 What he didn't know was that his younger sister,\\nElizabeth (Rachel Shelley) is completely against his outrageous ideas\\x85\\nElizabeth's first meeting with Bhuvan already got her attracted to him\\x85\\nUnsuspectingly, all of the villagers knows that she helps them purely\\nout of sympathy\\x85well, I guess it was that way but she fells in love\\nwith Bhuvan later on\\x85it just pains me to see that Elizabeth's love for\\nBhuvan is an unrequited one\\x85she remained Bhuvan's Radha\\x85 The cricket\\nmatch between Indians and British was really superb and very uplifting.\\nNevertheless, their wit and determination never let go unnoticed. Even\\nthe British officers cheered for their victory! It's really a\\nheartwarming story\\x85of Purity in Spirit, Sacrificial Love and that good\\nstill prevails..Aamir Khan has absolutely a god-given talent\\x85simply amazing\\x85he dances\\nlike any other talented men I know who perform. He was very good in the\\nrole\\x85he looks very appealing especially when Elizabeth imagined him in\\na princely suit! Gracie Singh looks convincing as Gauri who loves\\nBhuvan with all her heart. She looks bubbly and cute to me! She\\ndisplays an excellent facial expression that she can shift from one\\nemotion to another without any difficulty, I guess\\x85 They are really\\nperfect for each other\\x85 On the other hand, Elizabeth may have love\\nBhuvan with the same intensity as with Gauri's but I guess, they\\nweren't really meant to be with each other\\x85the rest of the men in\\nBhuvan's team were also fit for their roles\\x85they never failed to\\nuplift, share their sentiments and inspire me\\x85the British officials\\nshowcased a role of fairness\\x85they sympathized and cheered with the\\nvillager's victory.For an overall view, the movie was really amazing and I never will get\\ntired watching it all over again. The songs were enjoyable. I can even\\ndepict it in my mind\\x85sometimes I would hum it 'coz I cannot recite the\\nproper lyrics\\x85moreover, even if this film didn't win in the Oscars\\x85it's\\nall worth it\\x85\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nI normally find sports films only mildly interesting. Stuff like Field\\nof Dreams for example is OK, but only because it deals with big issues,\\nlike what\\'s important in Life. Also, I normally detest Football and\\nCricket. When I was young I was forced to watch both - I never\\nunderstood either and got bored pretty quickly. I think that Cricket is\\na game best broadcast on radio, and Footy on TV. Most times, they both\\nbore me.Not so in this case. The match only takes up the last 45 minutes of\\nthis 210+ minute film, but the build up to it is quite good filled with\\nintrigue, a love story, and a number of song and dance routines. By the\\ntime you get to the match you are totally aware of its importance, and\\nhow the Villagers are the underdogs. I won\\'t give away the ending, but\\nit really is suspenseful to the very end.If you only see one \"Bollywood\" film, make it this one!\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nLike most Bollywood films, this one satisfies on a lot of levels -\\nmusic, song, dance plot. Hit has history, sports and romance. Unlike\\nMorton, I had a good DVD copy from my local public library, the colors\\nwere brilliant and vibrant. The story contains a lot of clich\\xe9s, but\\nthat's Bollywood, but at least the Victorian Indian setting gives a new\\ntwist.At almost four hours, I did find it long. I would advise taking a break\\nat the intermission. Maybe watch it over two nights - or make dinner\\nduring intermission!!!!Great movie T\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nUnlike, say, Once Upon a Time in China, with which this film shares at\\nleast its English (sub)title, this is populist anti-Western colonialism\\ndone right! For one thing, having the villains actually be white goes a\\nlong way; Paul Blackthrone is an extremely effective \"evil Englishman,\"\\nand he actually speaks Hindi for a good chunk of his role! As a result,\\nwe get a real struggle, rather than an ultimately-meaningless proxy\\nbattle as we usually do in Tsui Hark\\'s film. This is, however, no\\nGibsonesque exercise in Anglo-bashing, and everything comes out\\nextremely balanced, perhaps too obviously so. He does, after all, have\\na sister that helps out the village people as they try to learn cricket\\nand beat his wager. More importantly, untouchables and Muslims, despite\\nearlier misgivings, are welcomed into the team, providing a heartening,\\ninclusive vision of Indian resistance against the occupier.What\\'s nice about this film is that it is clearly a high-profile\\nBollywood picture with an eye towards crossover, but it is not so\\ncompromised that it becomes unrecognizable to anyone who is already\\nsomewhat familiar with Bollywood. I imagine this is one of the better\\n\"gateway drugs\" for the genre, as the music is good and fits with the\\nplot, and one rarely feels that the more-than-three-hour running time\\nis needlessly padded. Sure, they could have made it shorter, but this\\nis actually epic enough to deserve it.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nI have never been able to find a Bollywood film that was so easy to sit\\nthru the entire film without getting impatient. Excellent pacing,\\nappealing acting, good music and about perfect movie entertainment.\\nI\\'ve seen quite a number of Bollywood musical productions as the local\\nIndian fast food restaurants tend to play non-stop DVDs that splice\\nonly the music and dance numbers together. It\\'s been very hard to get a\\ngood recommendation of an entire film to see. The few that I\\'ve been\\nable to watch were tough going, mainly due to the length and corny plot\\nlines. The musical numbers were usually entertaining. I had to stop this film (on DVD) and resume watching it at a later\\ntime. I found myself watching from the beginning again and not getting\\nbored! Director Ashutosh Gowariker has developed an excellent technique\\nthat I think the subtitle of the film gives a clue where his\\ninspiration comes from. There are many scenes that remained me of the\\nway Sergio Leone built scenes, introduced new characters and involved\\nthe viewer in the story. Really impressive.There is one problem, if this is your first Indian musical/drama,\\nthere\\'s not much in league with this film. To extend the Leone\\nconnection, it\\'s like watching \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" and\\nthen trying to find another Spaghetti western that comes even close.Excellent.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nFirst and foremost, to enjoy this film, and you can--very much--the\\nviewer should leave behind the cynical contemporary moviegoer who\\nexpects irony and sarcasm and nasty humor and fart jokes. This is an\\nold-fashioned film about old-fashioned values, and the fact that it was\\nmade in India makes little difference.Lagaan pits good against repression, the individual against the system,\\nand although to a modern viewer the outcome may be obvious, its great\\nfun getting there, with a lead actor who very much resembles the early\\nTony Curtis, full of impish sexuality and the power to use it, a man\\nwho challenges an unjust system--in this case the rule of the English\\nRaj before 1900. He impulsively challenges a ruling officer, a really\\nnasty type reminiscent of previous villainous prototypes...and then he\\nmust meet his challenge. Viewers not accustomed to the Bollywood product should be able to\\nbelieve that hundreds of drought-stricken villagers could break out in\\nunified and very colorful song when they see black clouds on the\\nway--if so, and you like romance and being on the winning them, this\\nfilm is great fun indeed!\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nAnalysis of A.R.Rahman's background score in Lagaan In Lagaan, every\\nknown ingredient of a typical Indian masala film is in near perfect\\nproportions. A.R.Rahman had to follow and use almost every single film\\nscoring rule and technique for writing the background score of Lagaan.\\nEvery principal character gets a musical theme. Every dramatic moment\\ngets an uplifting music score. Every song's melody is used\\nappropriately in the background score throughout the film. Every\\nmusical theme that is not based on any of the song's melody is\\ndeliberately tuned catchy, so that it could get a life even out of the\\nfilm. There are big bangs and grand orchestral outbursts. There are\\nmoments with measured silence amidst ample music. Every tear-jerking\\nmoment is filled with an instrumental soliloquy. Every instrument in\\nthe score is carefully chosen, and every piece is carefully\\norchestrated to convincingly transport us, a century back in time. The\\nbeauty of Lagaan's background score lies in the way all of these\\ntechniques come up in the right proportion, in the right context, in\\nthe right moments of the film....... to read more go to the link given\\nbelow www.backgroundscore.com/2011/06/10th-anniversary-of-lagaan.html\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nEverything I ever need to know about cricket I learned from this movie.\"Lagaan,\" in typical Bollywood fashion, is ridiculous and ridiculously\\nentertaining. It sounds like something conceived by Bialystock and\\nBloom -- a 3+ hour musical about British imperialism in India and the\\nsport of cricket -- but much like \"Springtime for Hitler\" it ends up\\nworking like a dream.\"Lagaan\" was nominated for the 2001 Academy Award for Best Foreign\\nLanguage Film, but it lost to \"No Man\\'s Land,\" the first and only entry\\nfrom Bosnia and Herzogovina in that category. This is also the year\\nthat produced \"Amelie\" as a nominee -- what a great year for foreign\\nlanguage films.Grade: A\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nLagaan has to be my favorite Bollywood film to date.When a local British governor doubles the lagaan (tax) on a small\\nvillage in the midst of a drought, the villagers make a deal that\\nthey'll be free of Lagaan for 3 years if they can beat the British in a\\ngame of cricket, or suffer triple the tax if they lose. Trouble is,\\nthey don't know the first thing about the game. It's a typical sports story with a rag tag team of underdogs squaring\\noff against an experienced, arrogant veteran team vividly dramatizing\\nthe Indian fight against British oppression. The well executed story is buttressed with lavish Victorian era\\ncostumes, beautiful cinematography, and several musical numbers that\\nare a cut above the average Bollywood song-and-dance numbers.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThis film happens to the very first Bollywood film that I have watched\\nin its entirety. Not being a fan of musicals, I braced myself as I\\npopped in the DVD. Well, 225 minutes past by rather quickly and\\nalthough there were moments where I was wondering exactly why I was\\nwatching a musical, but most of the time I was fairly well entertained.\\nI mean, granted, my critical side could pick at this film for a while,\\nbut that didn\\'t lessen my entertainment.The story is a pretty simple one and rolls forward predictably. The\\nsetup is this: poor Indian farmers get taxed by local British\\ncantonments through their raj. One day the British capriciously demand\\ndouble tax (lagaan = tax) and the villagers, suffering from an extended\\ndrought ask for it to be lifted. The big bad Brit offers them a\\nchallenge: win a cricket game against the Brits and no taxes for three\\nyears. Lose and pay thrice over. I like the word thrice.Complications arise as you have a British woman who goes against her\\ntyrannical brother and secretly aids the Indian team. Of course, since\\nit\\'s a classically styled musical, there\\'s a romance, complicated by a\\ntriangle (or perhaps a quadrilateral). And since it\\'s a sports film (a\\ncricket film), you have your requisite training montages. Since it\\'s a\\nmusical, you have plenty of musical/dance numbers. And it\\'s a\\nrecruiting film, so you could call it Bhuvan\\'s Eleven.All right, the good stuff first. The production values are high, the\\nphotography is gorgeous at times, the acting is simple but effective,\\nthe story is unapologetically escapist, the song and dance numbers\\naren\\'t so silly that I wanted to skip them and at least one of them\\nactually moved forward the underlying drama, rather than being just a\\nnumber. And then there\\'s the tension. The stakes are high from the\\nbeginning and the cricket game itself is presented in just a way that\\nthe tension never really lets up until all almost four hours is said\\nand done.One of the problems is that the characters are all very simplistic. The\\nvillain character is played over the top, which makes sense in the\\nsimple world of simple characters that\\'s described here. Perhaps if you\\nlet yourself get caught up in the simple world presented and can hit\\nthe switch in your brain that cares about what\\'s real, this isn\\'t a\\nproblem. But I think the character is so entirely bad (and the hero so\\nentirely good) that it\\'s hard to believe characters in this movie to be\\nreal, for the most part.Another problem I have with this film is a problem I have with most\\nmusicals: many of the song and dance numbers are long and some of them\\nare unnecessary for the purposes of storytelling. I understand that\\nit\\'s all part of a show, but sometimes I feel like all these things are\\neither just tacked on, or a story is tacked onto a series of somewhat\\nrelated songs. Which was why I was relieved that not every number was\\npointless. The movie is also really long and some trimming could help\\nit be a little easier to find time to watch.I\\'d say that its escapism is a negative trait, but I can\\'t help but\\nwonder if the primary audience is one that faces the harsh realities of\\nthe world every day and needs a little hope in their lives. All the\\nsame, I can\\'t help but wonder if some of the little things the film\\ndoes to \"say something\" about the problems of the caste system, etc.,\\nare done with little meaning, but to just appease the hopes of those\\nwatching. There is something to say about the critics of escapist films\\nin that it helps keep the disenfranchised appeased in their situation\\nand holding out hope rather than doing something themselves to change\\nthe situation.And when it comes to believability, the initial love triangle is fairly\\nbelievable, but the second complication makes me uncomfortable, since\\nit appears to be over-idealized and part of me thinks that it\\'s also,\\nin part, an unbelievable male fantasy, even if not acted on.Still, for as long a watch as it was, I was suitably entertained. The\\nonly real barrier to me watching more Bollywood films in the future is\\ncarving out the heroic amount of time necessary to take one in. I\\nsuspect that this film will be a joy to musical lovers. 7/10.\\n',\n",

So I\\'m not going to patronize it anymore, because everyone\\nalready knows how great it is. But I did find a couple of negative\\npoints in the movie. Things that were either silly or unnecessary. What\\nwere they? I felt that the whole romantic angle between Elizabeth and\\nBhuvan was completely useless and could have been avoided completely.\\nWhy couldn\\'t Elizabeth have wanted to help them purely out of the\\ngoodness of her heart? In fact, after their first meeting when the\\nvillagers are observing the cricket match in hiding, Elizabeth asks\\ntheir names, and after they\\'ve left, she actually whispers \"Bhuvan\" to\\nherself... as if she\\'s already falling for him.. ridiculous! In fact, i\\nthought the whole Bhuvan/Elizabeth/Gauri triangle was useless and did\\nnothing for the plot. yes, it gave a chance for our \"Gori Mem\" to sing\\na song, but come on!! The last few words in the movie claim that\\nElizabeth never married, and is referred to by Amitabh Bachchan (the\\nnarrator) as her remaining Bhuvan\\'s Radha forever. A little laughable.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nLagaan is absolutely a stunning piece of work by the producer-director\\nteam of Aamir Khan and Ashutosh Gowariker. It is one of the best films\\ni have seen in my lifetime if not the best. Thoroughly entertaining and\\nwithout meaningless subplots. The screenplay is as good as it gets and\\nthe 3 hour+ film just flies by. The cricket match in the climax is an\\nabsolute highlight of the film and is as nail biting as a real sports\\nmatch. The game is explained so wonderfully during the film that people\\nwith very little or no knowledge of cricket will understand what\\ncricket is all about. Aamir Khan is delightful as the enthusiastic\\nBhuvan. He takes to the role as a fish takes to water. He is one of the\\nbest actors of India and people who see the film will see why he is\\nreckoned a perfectionist in India. In short, he does magnificently well\\ndoubling as the producer and the protagonist. Newcomer Gracy Singh\\n(Gauri) is a revelation. She is simply adorable as the jealous village\\nbelle. She dances her way into viewers\\' heart esp in the \"Radha kaise\\nna jale\" number. Rest of the cast is on target as well. The music by\\nA.R.Rehman is another positive aspect of the film. The songs heighten\\nthe impact of the film unlike many other Indian films where songs act\\nas deterrents in the ongoings. Cinematography has to be seen to be\\nbelieved.

       " u\"\\n\\nYeah I watched lagaan the year it came out and I thought it was one the\\nbest movies that Indians have ever made and they should be proud of\\nthemselves.Its movies like these that make a person feel good about themselves and\\nit makes you want to achieve more in life.I remember when I first watched Lagaan (3yrs ago), it was on VHS the\\nprint was terrible but it didn't stop me from watching it. I loved it\\neven though they had cut some bits out. I later got it on DVD and I\\nmust say the quality is much better. I kept watching this movie over\\nand over again and have studied it also, I love the making of a movie\\nits so intriguing.Everyone puts on great a performance; Aamir khan is the Protagonist, he\\nso realistic and versatile. He has been my fav actor since 1990 in Dil,\\nhe was great, he's one of the finest actors Bollywood has (Also you\\nhave got watch Dil Chahta Hai he puts on a great performance). Gracy is\\nnew and unique she will do fine, no one would have suited as lead\\nactress except her, a great job. All the eleven members of the team\\nalso deserved to be applauded it was cause of them that lagaan worked,\\nsame goes for the other opposite team. Rachel Shelley and Paul\\nBlackthorne have done great acting; since they can't speak Hindi it\\nwould have been very difficult. They bring a certain amount of realism\\nto the story and how British people use to be like back in the late\\n1800's.But most importantly, the man behind the scene deserves the most credit\\nAshutosh Gowariker the writer and director. This would not have been an\\neasy movie to make and bringing it to silver screen is something\\namazing.I have been reading other peoples comments on lagaan as well, and many\\npeople have a problem that the length of the movie is to long, (hey\\nlook at the bright side at least you get your moneys worth) I can\\nunderstand, in the beginning I found the movie a tad slow but it needed\\nto introduce u to the village, characters, and most importantly the\\ntime frame. But once that goes ur glued to the movie till the end.Indian movies are very different to western movies, and what makes it\\nunique are the song and dance routines, I thought the music and lyrics\\nwere so beautiful. The background music was superb. People also\\ncomplained that song and dance routines are waste of time I don't think\\nso, I think it's a way celebrating life and people like that.I really wished that lagaan would have got the Oscars, it would have\\nbeen the first one for India, and all their hard work would have payed\\noff. I haven't seen No mans Land but from the sound of it, it looks\\ngood. India just had some tough competitors.Now that lagaan has opened doors internationally India will very soon\\nget an Oscar and I think it will be an Aamir Khan movie, which will get\\nit.Lagaan will always remain a story untouched; Wonderfully made and\\nshowcased, I would give it ten out of ten, one of the greatest movies\\nof all time.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThe story line is your basic underdog movies so I can't say it has an\\noriginal story.  Having watched or rather endured numerous foreign films,\\nI\\nnormally expect production quality to be poor at best.  This one has\\nproduction quality that rivals your Hollywood studios.  Add to this it has\\nmanaged to blend drama, sports competition and musical dance numbers into\\none film which actually works and its simply one of the best movies I've\\nseen foreign or domestic.Oh, don't let the length of the film scare you off... though it may be\\nlonger than Gandhi, you'll never be bored or restless during this\\none.\\n\",\n",

I am not a sports\\nperson and this movie definitely had a sports theme, but I didn't mind\\nit. It felt kind of long towards the end when they played the game. It\\nwas a story of facing adversity in anyway. Its love story was told\\ncompletely without kissing which in this day and age is very\\nimpressive.

I was surprised, given\\nthe film\\'s intended audience (i.e., Indian), but \"Lagaan\" bends over\\nbackwards to make sure that even people who have never heard of cricket know\\nwhat\\'s going on and understand the rules as much as they need to in order to\\nappreciate the progress of the game. (North American baseball and football\\nfilms are never so charitable to outsiders.)And forget the reputation the sport has among those who don\\'t know how it\\'s\\nplayed. Cricket is, in fact, the most exciting, and certainly the most\\ndramatic, of all sports. Yes, test matches can last up to five days (and had\\nbeen known to last longer before the five-day limit was imposed), but that\\'s\\nthe point: only cricket CAN last for five days without sending the crowd to\\nsleep. Most other sports would be pushing it at two hours. Only a game of\\ncricket COULD bear the emotional weight which \"Lagaan\" places upon its\\nlengthy finale. The conclusion to \"Lagaan\" is long, at once exhilarating and\\nalmost unbearably tense \\x96 and, ultimately, liberating.No other sport is so well suited to the democratic ideals \"Lagaan\" wishes to\\nexpress, either. It\\'s possible to describe someone by saying \"He looks like\\na rugby player\" or \"He looks like a basketball player\"; but \"He looks like a\\ncricket player\" is meaningless. Almost any physical skill can find a\\nfoothold in cricket. (And you never know WHICH skill will prove crucial in\\nwinning a match.) Cricket admits all sorts; but once admitted, the division\\nof labour is admirably egalitarian. Every single player, even those who got\\ninto the team solely on the strength of their ability to throw a ball so as\\nto make it bounce sideways, must bat; everyone, even those whose only\\nnatural ability is to swing a bat at a moving object, must field. It\\'s a\\npity that not everyone must bowl, but the uncertain length of innings would\\nmake such a rule unworkable; and anyway, in long test matches especially, a\\ncricket captain would LIKE every member of his team to be able to bowl, and\\ncertainly wants as many different styles of bowling at his disposal as\\npossible. \\x85The result of all this is, the world\\'s best cricket players look\\nnothing like one another, yet considerably like ordinary human\\nbeings.\\x85But back to the film. It\\'s marvellous. It comes along at just the right\\ntime to prove (although it has been proven many times in the past) that\\nfilms considerably longer than Peter Jackson\\'s \"Lord of the Rings\" episodes\\ndon\\'t have to be monumentally boring. \"Lagaan\" is never less than\\nentertaining, and (despite the occasional moment when it stretches too far \\x96\\nthere are maybe two or three moments in the whole three-and-three-quarter\\nhours) ends up being genuinely moving and inspiring. By saying this I\\'m\\nprobably betraying the fact that it\\'s the first big Bollywood picture I\\'ve\\nseen; but it also shows that the skill and energy required to stage live\\naction musical numbers has not vanished from the face of the Earth, after\\nall. It\\'s not true that \"Lagaan\" has everything. It\\'s better than that: it\\nhas precisely as much as it can hold together in the one story, and no\\nmore.Just one teensy little criticism \\x85Spoiler ahead\\x85As you\\'d guess from the subtitle (\"Once Upon a Time in India\"), \"Lagaan\" is,\\nin addition to everything else, a fairytale; or at least, while the bulk of\\nits presence is elsewhere, it has a kind of shadow life as a fairytale, too.\\nThe rule-of-three motif is used frequently: the same thing happens twice;\\nthen, the third time, it\\'s different. I was expecting this rule to be used\\non the elephant (and I\\'m sure everyone else in the audience was, too). Two\\ntimes the ball rolls through a gap in the boundary to annoy a nearby\\nelephant; I was sure that the third time this happened, the elephant would\\nsit on the ball, thus allowing the local team (probably when they were\\nstruggling with batsmen who for one reason or another were constrained in\\ntheir ability to run back and forth, or when they needed to score a\\nseemingly impossible number of runs in the last few overs) to get, say, ten\\nruns off the one ball. But it didn\\'t happen. We never see the elephant\\nagain. The game DOES end in fine style, and I suppose in a manner more\\nrespectful to the nature of the game, but all the same \\x85 I was a little\\ndisappointed. That\\'s all.I wasn\\'t disappointed by anything else.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nLagaan is a tale from India in the times were the Indian people had to\\npay high taxes to the British rulers, since India was considered to be\\na ''piece'' of the British Empire. In one village where Bhuvan, Gauri\\nand other friends live, they asked for the British rulers to not pay\\nthe taxes of that year, since the rains didn't come. The British\\ndecides to challenge the guys of that village to play cricket with\\nthem: if the Indians win, their wish will become true; if it doesn't,\\nthey will have to pay even bigger taxes to the British officers. I think 'Lagaan'is a masterpiece and it was one of the first Indian\\nmovies I watched in my life. The costumes and scenarios are beautiful\\nas the musics sang.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThe best cricket movie ever made.Set in India in the late-1800s, the local British rulers are imposing\\nexcessively high taxes on the local population. One of the local\\nvillagers has a run-in with the senior British officer, resulting in a\\ncricket match between the British and the villagers. If the villagers\\nwin, they don't have to pay taxes for three years. If they lose, they\\nhave to pay three times their usual taxes.Interesting, engaging movie with some of the most realistic cricket\\nscenes you'll see in a movie. The April 2004 edition of The Wisden Cricketer, probably the foremost\\ncricket magazine in the world, had their list of the top 10 cricket\\nmoments in movies, and Lagaan come in at number 1. I wholeheartedly\\nagree with their assessment. Cricket in movies is normally very badly done, looking as if the\\ndirector had no clue about the sport. Even Bodyline, the movie about\\nthe infamous 1932 Bodyline series, had some laughable moments (eg the\\nEngland wicket-keeper, Les Ames, standing up to the wicket for the\\nexpress pace of Harold Larwood!). Considering that it was a movie\\nexclusively about an historic cricket series, thus is even more\\ncricket-centric than Lagaan, which is as much a human drama as a\\ncricket movie, Bodyline's cricket scenes were very badly done.\\n(Bodyline's script was just as bad, very biased and propaganda-like:\\ngoing out of it's way to be anti-English). I expected similar inaccuracies in Lagaan and was pleasantly surprised.\\nWhile there are some minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, this is\\ntruly the most accurate and best cricket movie ever made. It is also\\ngood as a drama, not just a cricket movie, so recommended for those\\nless-into-cricket too. (Aside: Bodyline came in at Number 3 on Wisden's list).\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nOne of the greatest movies ever made in Indian movie history.\\nExtraordinary direction, acting, script, music, background music,\\ncostumes, art direction and cinematography. A roller coaster of\\nemotions including exhilaration, patriotism, anger, fear, romance,\\ntension, inspiration, humor, empathy and brotherhood. Exquisite\\ndepiction of the then society, gram panchayats, social psychology,\\noccupational structures, caste hierarchies, untouchability, dependence\\non rain, catastrophe of droughts, poverty, administrative structures,\\ncolonial mentality etc. It requires a great amount of talent to present\\nall these by engaging different types of audience till the end without\\nboring. Besides, acting of the English actors and portrayal of the\\nemotions of the crowd during the match are terrific according to Indian\\nstandards.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nI had seen spoofs of the Baliwood genre (The Guru comes to mind) but\\nthis is the first I have actually seen. I liked especially that they\\nused subtitles instead of dubbing. It was an interesting look at the\\ntime and culture of Victorian India from the Indian as opposed to\\nEuro-centric viewpoint. The musical numbers bring to mind Hollywood of\\nthe forties and Broadway.I was interested too to see the costumes and props of the period, again\\nfrom the Indian point of view. It is not something kids growing up in\\nwhite-bread suburbia get exposed to as a rule, at least not in the 60\\'s\\nand 70\\'s when I was in school. So I found it educational as well as\\nentertaining.There was certainly more of the older style Hollywood in the acting\\nthan the more \"method\" approach of modern actors. Characters were\\narchetypal rather than deep or subtle.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nAn Indian friend of mine shared this film with me. I enjoyed it very\\nmuch. I had seen Indian films before, so I was prepared for the \"cast\\nof a thousand\" musical production numbers. I also knew something about\\nIndian history and culture, but almost nothing about cricket, except\\nthat people from former British colonies have become superior players,\\nmuch in the same way that baseball players from Latin and Caribbean\\nbackgrounds are now powerhouses of the \"American\" sport. I thought\\n\"Lagaan\" would be mostly \"about cricket\". I was not prepared for a film\\nthat had so many levels.I think it is plain that the villagers\\' struggle to \"beat the British\\nat their own game\" is a metaphor for the \"power of the human spirit\"\\n(regardless of culture), as well as the nascent potential of India, and\\nother \"non-western\" countries, to learn from and compete with the west\\nin spheres of art, science, culture, industry, and sports. The film\\ntries to be \"balanced\" in showing that not ALL westerners are \"bad\\nguys\", nor are all Indians \"good guys\", however, there is a clear\\nvillain and a likable hero.The film weaves a romantic subplot, historical elements, the main\\nconflict (multi-caste/ethnic Indian villagers vs. the haughty British\\noccupiers), the details of the sport (cricket), comic and dramatic\\nelements, even song & dance numbers in such a way that the film does\\nnot seem overlong. The film is plotted and paced beautifully. Some\\nmight find it too \"saccharine\", but I think that, like the sports\\nclassic \"Rocky\", \"Lagaan\" believes in the qualities of compassion,\\npatience, endurance, ingenuity, teamwork, sportsmanship and love that\\nit espouses - and as a result, the film works! If you have NOT seen many Indian films other than \"Monsoon Wedding\",\\nbut you are open-minded and like sports, culture and history, be\\nprepared to step back in time to the days of the British Raj as seen\\nfrom an Indian point of view. I think you will enjoy \"Lagaan\".\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nI was absolutely stunned by this film. It was a good, fresh and very\\nmuch welcome change for Bollywood.Having taken a major risk here, Aamir Khan and Ashutosh Gowariker tried\\nthe stunt of a historically placed Hindi Film. Yet they did it so\\ncleverly and without much fuss that it was compatible with the Indian\\nMainstream, as well as contain so much depth to story and characters\\nthat it impressed higher categories of film-viewers too and thus\\nreached the Oscars.The genially balanced blend of Myth-Legend and Bollywood-Spice Film had\\neverything I desire from a good film: Fresh and interesting visuals,\\nrich and diverse characters to relate to, stunning music and a riveting\\nstoryline. A game of cricket to decide a dispute, not more. It wasn't\\nnecessary.Normally such a film would not have had much success in India, for\\ncomplicated themes requiring some general knowledge (in this case\\nhistorical) just does not click. Indians want real-life soaps 3 hours\\nlong.But this worked, because it took to the most primitive forms of\\nentertainment and didn't get to involved in historical matters.I loved it. And I loved the way it was made.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nLagaan. It's not everyday affair when something like Lagaan happens.\\nWhen Bollywood entered the new millennium, it was still craving for a\\nturning point which takes Bollywood to international stage. Ashutosh\\nGowariker came with an idea which defies Bollywood norms by leaps and\\nbounds, Aamir Khan is hooked by the idea as an actor and takes the\\nrisky decision of producing the movie on its own so that idea gets the\\nmuch deserved heart felt treatment and what happened later is a history\\nnow. Lagaan year after year is considered the Bollywood's bravest\\neffort of the new millennium.In its unbelievable plot where our hero a villager played by Mr.\\nperfectionist Aamir Khan accepts the challenge of egoist British\\nCommander Officer to play a cricket match in which if village wins,\\nthey need not to pay taxes for next three years. Even with a run time\\nof 3 hours and 40 minutes, movie never gets out of steam, in fact gets\\nbetter with every passing moment. An array of colorful characters\\nplayed by credible actors, the mesmerizing music and back ground score\\nof maestro A.R.Rahman, soulful lyrics of Javed Akhtar, a water tight\\nscreenplay with not a single out of the place scene and the genuine\\nfeeling of honesty and simplicity, all these factors make Lagaan an\\noutstanding movie of modern times. First half is a smooth journey of\\nintroducing characters, the challenge, the team making and the match\\npreparation. Second half is a like watching a nail biting cricket\\nmatch. The movie is a perfect example that with full commitment and\\nhard work, Bollywood can create the international level cinema with\\nease.Lagaan turned out to be an inspiration for audience and its makes\\nalike. After Lagaan, Aamir Khan appeared into Taare Zameen Par, Rang De\\nBasanti and 3 Idiots. Ashutosh made Swades and Jodhaa Akbar. I am going\\nwith mind blowing 9 out of 10 for Lagaan. It's a sin for any movies fan\\nto miss Lagaan.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nI am still seething with disappointment that this film did not win the\\nAcademy Award for best foreign language film the year it was nominated.\\nWhat is especially upsetting is that the movie that did win was far\\ninferior in every way imaginable. Ah, yes, the politics of The Academy!Lagaan is a marvel of fine film making. It is a triumph for Garwariker,\\nthe actors, the composer, the technicians on every level. There is\\nimmaculate attention paid to the framing of all shots. A breathtaking\\ntour de force in Cinematography and fine acting. Lagaan is a colorful melange of music, romance, drama and sports that\\nis completely engrossing despite being nearly 4 hours long. This\\nmasterpiece reveals just how far Bollywood has come and, in many ways,\\nsurpassed Hollywood in inspired film making.A must-see for the entire family!!\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nWhen a poor village in colonial times cannot afford to pay the tax levied by\\nthe British troops, rebellious farmer Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) accepts a wager:\\nif the villagers can beat the British officers at cricket, they will be\\nexempt from tax for three years, if they lose, they'll have to pay triple\\nthe amount. This is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that Hollywood can no longer\\nmake: it's crowd-pleasing and shamelessly manipulative but never in an\\nobvious or cynical way and even though the \\x91underdog vs. champ'-plot is\\ncompletely predictable, it's done with such sincerity and enthusiasm that it\\nfeels as if it's being invented anew. \\nLagaan offers four hours (yes, four!) of the kind of cinema that makes you\\nroot for the good guys, despise the villain and hope the hero gets the girl.\\nAnd you won't be able to get those songs out of your head.**** \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThroughly entertaining combining two of India's great obsessions - Bollywood\\nfilm & the sport of cricket.Certainly not a short film at over 3&1/2 hours & although it last longer\\nthan the current Zimbabwean batting line up would, Lagaan moves along at a\\nbrisk pace, suffering few if any dull patches.The cinematography is great, as is the sound.  The songs are fun\\ntoo!The cricket scenes are well staged & filmed quite well.I was impressed overall with the English cast, especially the fact that it\\nappears many of the cast appeared to have learnt to speak fluent Hindi,\\nminor touches such as these can make a huge difference to a film like\\nthis.A great film for cricket fans & non cricket fans alike, even if the end is a\\ntad predictable & not unexpected. 8/10\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nLike many other viewers, I just picked this DVD up from my local library not\\nsure quite what to expect.  2 discs and 225 minutes later I too was cheering\\nand whooping in delight.  OK, the story is nothing original but the\\nexquisite manner and sheer love of detail in which it is told cannot fail to\\nwin you over.  The Indian leads are charming, funny, delightful and earn our\\ncompassion whilst the English leads play the Imperalists down to a tea (no\\npun intended) And  as for th supporting cast!  Wow...just sheer joy.  For me\\nI can't understand why the overrated mish-mash that is The Pianist scoops up\\nthe plaudits whilst this glorious understated masterpiece slips by\\nunnoticed.  Go rent it now!!!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nAccording to Indian flavors, this movie is long and choral, but visually\\nextremely powerful and musically stunning by its perfection and strange\\nbeauty. Every character out of the over twenty main characters from both\\nthe\\nlocal and 'visitors' team is wonderfully developed and seamless\\nintegrated\\nin this simple yet eternal tale on bravery and honor, in which thrill\\nbuilds\\nup as the match goes ahead.The simple embedded love story works as a join between two worlds, two\\ncultures, which actually never meet in a direct clash. A beautifully\\ncrafted\\nmovie to enjoy for both western and eastern audiences, where cricket is\\njust\\na wonderful alibi.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nI usually don't like foreign films, and the longest movie I've ever sat\\nthrough and enjoyed was about 2 hours and 15 minutes. So I should have\\nhated\\nthis movie. But I didn't at all. I loved it so much I went out and bought\\nit. Sure, it's predictable as hell, and it can get kind of corny and\\ncliche\\nat times, but I was too absorbed in the movie to really notice. I highly\\nrecommend it. 9.5/10\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nI rented this movie based on a trailer that I saw on another foreign film\\nrental.  I had really no idea what to expect.  I couldn't have been more\\npleasantly surprised.  The trailer I saw was so vibrant, but there was no\\nway to know that it would be written and shot so well.  (Not to mention\\nthat\\nthe cast was beautiful and brilliant.)  It took about 15-20 min to\\nacclimate\\nmyself to the film, BUT, I was entering a foreign country and exposing\\nmyself to a completely unknown culture.LAGAAN was a touching, well-written musical film that , I think, should be\\nfor the Hindu community what THE SOUND OF MUSIC is to Americans.  Though\\nit\\nwas lengthy, the script surprised me at several pivital turns.  The stakes\\nwere raised for our heroic villagers more times than I expected.  The\\nmusic\\nwas new for me and I became mesmerized by it.  The English translations of\\nthe songs were nothing short of heart-wrenching poetry.  The diversity of\\nthe characters added conflict and comedy.  Many of them had to overcome\\npersonal downfalls to lift their community out of bondage.  I cared not\\nonly\\nfor the hero and heroine, but about 7 or 8 minor supporting characters.\\nTHAT is not only good writing, but F***ing brilliant acting!!!! This movie\\nwas colorful, beautiful, spiritually uplifting, and entertaining, while\\nstill being educational on facets of the Hindu culture/spirituality, the\\ncaste system (the most moving character for me was 'the Untouchable') and\\na\\nperiod of their history.  I screamed and cheered.  I got misty and cried.\\nIt was a long film, but well worth the wait.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\n\\nI enjoyed this film very much. It is a classic story in which the\\nunderdog\\neventually triumphs over his suppressors. Colonial times revisited, and\\nhard\\ntimes they were for the villagers in India where the film is set. The\\nBritish demand more tax ('lagaan') to be payed, but since a drought has\\nplagued the country there is hardly enough crop for the farmers to\\nsurvive.\\nThey are desperate. What to do?\\nHopefully a game of cricket will change their fate. The villagers select\\na\\nteam that have to defeat the British who of course think themselves\\nGoliath.\\nIt is a game against all odds. Should the villagers win, they won't have\\nto\\npay 'lagaan' for a period of three years. Should they lose, they will\\nhave\\nto pay triple the amount.\\nThe three day cricket game in the film is portrayed very convincingly. I\\nwatched 'Lagaan' on dvd with two cricket fans like me and we thought the\\ncricket scenes were very realistic.\\nThe story develops in a slow manner but that does not raise any\\nobjections,\\nfor in a way the duration of the film (225 minutes!) reflects the pace of\\nlife in 1890's rural India as well as the course of a decent game of\\ncricket.\\nThere is ample song and dance in the film as well which sort of gives it\\nan\\noriental 'Sound of Music'-like pretension. The dance scenes are\\nwell-orchestrated and quite enjoyable, though they tend to hold up the\\nstory\\ntoo much. I suppose this is very Bollywood.\\nTo summarize: yeah, I like 'Lagaan' a lot!\\n\",\n",

After reading numerous glowing reviews, though,\\nI\\ndecided to give it a chance. None of the local video rental places had a\\ncopy (no surprise there), and I was hesitant to buy something I had so many\\ndoubts about. My wife finally got sick of hearing my debates with myself\\nover it every time we went to Best Buy, so she bought it for me for Fathers\\nDay. I'm now thrilled that she did! This is easily one of the best movies\\nI've seen this year. While I felt the first 15-20 minutes or so dragged a\\nlittle (this may simply have been me adjusting to the language &\\nsubtitles--something that generally happens any time I watch a movie in a\\nlanguage I've not heard before), the rest of the movie was spectacular. The\\nstory moves along at a good pace, and is fun and engrossing. The music,\\nwhich was one of the things I had the most doubts about, was great (the\\nsole\\nexception being the English-language portion of the love\\nsong).Overall, it was a fun, energetic movie whose tone reminded me of an old\\nHollywood musical.

However, after settling with a bag of\\npopcorn, I closely observed the first few minutes.  Thus, I was sucked out\\nof the stereotype of an Indian movie and drawn to the screen.My rating - 10/10.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThe Movie takes you back to 1940's when INDIA was a British Colony. Back\\nthen Indian Farmers had to give atleast 50% of the Cultivated product to\\nthe\\nEnglish Govt as a form of Revenue, which means LAGAAN in Indian Language.\\nAnd one season There was Not enough Rain for people to grow enough to\\nlive,\\nand giving lagaan was not even a possibilty but british Rulers are way too\\nshrued to exempt them from that so they leave them with one Condition in\\norder to get rid of the LAGAAN which was to Defeat the british Rulers in a\\ngame of Cricket and if they don't win they might have to pay double tax\\nwhich was to give them everything they cultivate the whole season. So one\\nrevolutionist farmer Aamir Khan (the main lead of the film) takes up the\\nchallenge thinking that its almost impossible for them to pay them even\\nsingle tax, double tax wouldn't make anything worse then it already is...\\nso\\nthe film describes the sheer power and will of these Indian farmers which\\nmakes them Succeed!! The movie is nominated in The OSCARS under the best\\nforiegn film and I believe it should get it with Ease... The BOTTOM LINE -\\nA\\ngreat MOVIE ... \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nIf this movie didn't get the Oscar there is definitely something wrong\\nwith\\nthe Oscars. Also other movies that are up against Oscars are low budget\\nmovies that no one's care about Lagaan have made a lot of money,\\nrecognition\\nand deserve the Oscar.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nA British officer made a deal with a Indian not to raise the taxes in his\\nvillage for three year. The condition is the Indians must win in cricket\\nin\\norder not to pay triple the tax. They did not know how to play cricket at\\nfirst. The Indian was determined to win the game against the British. With\\nthe help of a Englishwoman, the Indians have a fighting chance to win the\\ngame. The film does not seem to long when watching it. The singing and\\ndancing is quite entertaining to see.  \\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nLagaan is not about cricket which might have been interpreted.\\nI sincerely hope it wins a long overdue Oscar for best foreign language\\nfilm.It has everything-excellent production values,tight script,great\\nacting\\nfrom Aamir and rest of the cast,excellent music.It is in other words a\\ngreat\\ncelebration of  Indian cinema and culture and above all Indian\\nspirit....\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nOK so it has sub titles and you have to read as you go. Who cares??!!\\nJust watch the film it totally speaks for it's self. The music in this\\nfilm is AMAZING! Phenomenal dance sequences. I love the sound track.\\nWish I could buy it. I can't speak the language and I still catch\\nmyself humming a favorite song or two. And the male lead in this\\nmovie.... What a hunk!! The female lead in the movie has an amazing\\nsinging voice. The only negative thing I can say is that some of the\\ncricket scenes are really really long, and you can feel the summer heat\\nof that field they're playing on. To whom it may concern there are\\npeople in the US that really need more Indian film ASAP! God Bless L\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nWhat an amazing film! Although a loooong film (over 3\\xbd hours), my wife and I\\nwere nevertheless captivated by the variety and suspense. If you have never\\nseen a Hindi film before, or if you are not in tune with Indian culture,\\nthen my advice is to have patience while watching the first 30 minutes or\\nso. This is certainly not Hollywood, but 100% Bollywood - at its best!\\nAlthough I live in a country with cricket only second to rugby, I do not\\nlike cricket and never watch it - but I did in fact enjoy the cricket in\\nthis film - my wife included.  \\n \\nTowards the end, there is a spiritual aspect of this film that brought tears\\nto my eyes and radiance to my heart. Marvelous! There is not much more that\\nI can add here (considering the many wonderful comments below) except to say\\nthat the romance and symbolism is a joy to see. Yes, there are some\\nsimplistic soap opera segments, but this is in fact a Bollywood film, so I\\nembrace this difference and see it as wholesome and refreshingly moralistic.  \\nYou will feel energised and elevated by this film. See it and spread the\\nword. A message to Bollywood: \"More films like this - please!\"\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nI\\'ve never been a fan of Bollywood movies, but I found \"Lagaan\" to be\\nan enjoyable film.Of course, it isn\\'t \"Two Women,\" \"The Bicycle Thief,\" \"Seven Samurai,\"\\n\"Umberto D\" or even on par with \"The Apu Trilogy\" and \"Salaam Bombay!\"\\n(which, by the way, should have won the Oscar for best foreign film,\\ninstead of \"Pelle the Conqueror.\") But not every film can be on par\\nwith these classics and life would be awfully boring if that were the\\ncase. Sometimes, you ought to be able to sit through a corny film and\\nenjoy it - and that\\'s what happens with \"Lagaan.\"There\\'s something delightfully infectious about \"Lagaan.\" And although\\nthe running time is close to four hours, the time whizzes by.I was not bored by this film. It was a fun experience, the music has a\\njovial quality to it and the entire film is truly a thoroughly\\nsatisfying experience. If you want to see a \"The Bicycle Thief\" or \"Two\\nWomen,\" and that\\'s the only type of film you want to see, then by all\\nmeans see those masterpieces. But if you\\'re in the mood for some\\ndiverting fun, watch \"Lagaan.\" It is worth it.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nFirst of all, i want to thank my parents for having this DVD in their\\ncollection : I don't know how they got it but with their help, i could\\nfind a awesome movie that, as usual, becomes totally transparent in our\\nwestern and french medias !For sure, as we are brainwashed to expect big productions or big names,\\nwe never pay attention to oriental movies and it's a big error as this\\none took me back to the candid joy as a kid discovering films for a 1st\\ntime !In short, this movie has all the simple things that makes you feel\\nhappy :1) You leave your daily life and you are taken into a new one : here we\\nare in India, late XIX and it's good as this land and folklore are\\nnearly forgotten by filmmakers : Except Indy 2, Octopussy, i don't have\\nwatched other movies happening there ! 2) At last, we have another point of view ! actually, when i see a\\nwestern movie happening in Orient, it's about a war in which the\\nnatives are depicted as enemies and West the good savior. Here, as told\\nin the excellent movie Brother, we left this propaganda and are closer\\nto the truth : West is an arrogant invader that spoils and squeezes\\nresources from the natives ! This is maybe the first time i hear this\\nargument in a movie and it's good ! 3) In our materialistic, consumerist and loose-valued society, we take\\nanyone different from us as retarded, dumb and degenerate. Here, i see\\nwomen veiled and working for the household and i can't say they are\\nexploited as told by today propaganda. Those people wear traditional\\nclothes but they can express their feelings and they have more\\ninteresting things to say that i'm a beauty, see my perfect body, etc\\x85 4) For sure, we are frightened by the fact that we know nobody's name\\non the cover, as much we are instructed to except big names for a big\\nmovie ! However, all those fresh faces are cool, talented and crush the\\nHollywood and french myth ! Newcomers can do as good and even better\\nthan films legends ! 5) The movie has a clear story, with well done cliffhangers involving\\nwell-defined and balanced characters and the production knows how to\\ntell it : so it's not about like video music and cutting frame each\\nseconds, grading colors to a what-if world and confusing special\\neffects with a story ! At last, as it's a sport movie, we find as in\\nRocky all the values that sports can teach (solidarity, efforts) and i\\nmust praise all the production because the 3 days match was not all\\nrepetitive or unintelligible but this final showdown was a test in\\nhuman nature !So if you are tired of seeing the same faces, desperate of propaganda\\nand endless violence, try this movie and you will discover that yes,\\nthere's a different way to do movies \\x85 and different cultures in the\\nworld !\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nLagaan is film that I watched without any expectation and it absolutely\\nblew my mind.The film revolves around three characters Bhuvan played by\\nAamir Khan,Gauri played by Gracy Singh and Elizabeth played by Rachel\\nShelley.The film\\'s central character is Bhuvan,who is a spirited and\\noutstanding young man who firmly stands for the rights of the villagers\\nwho are oppressed by their British dictators.Lagaan was a tax that was\\na compulsory payment at the time of British rule.The price of tax\\nincreased at the will of the British and people couldn\\'t afford to pay\\ntheir taxes.Village people had to starve to pay their\\ntaxes.Therefore,the young and brave Bhuvan made a deal that the British\\nwould waive the tax of villagers on the fate of cricket match.This is\\nthe main plot of the story and the rest of the parts make up the movie.\\nThe first frame of the movie explains the meaning of Lagaan and setting\\nthe tone of the 19th century in India.The first few frames of the film\\nshowed the beautiful Indian villages in the late 19th century and\\nimmediately setting the tone for the audience to pull them into the\\nancient Indian world.The film took its time to introduce its characters\\nto the audience to firmly understand the sentiments of the Indians\\nduring that time.The important characters who were Bhuvan and Gauri\\nwere introduced first in the opening scenes while the character of\\nElizabeth was introduced later on.Along with these three main\\ncharacters,there were more than ten characters which had important\\ndialogues throughout the film. The first positive that I noticed from\\nthe beginning is the lush cinematography of the film.The man behind the\\ncamera deserves all my salutes for really raising the bars in the level\\nof making films.The camera angles in the day time and the aerial shots\\nof the village were excellent.The use of color and the tone of\\ncinematography really brought me back to that time zone.The second\\npositive was the art design the of the film.The art director deserves\\nall credits for creating sets that looked and felt real.The sets of the\\nvillages and the palaces were really beautiful and made me feel that I\\nwas in that period.Coming the curtain raiser,the performances of the\\ncast.The life of the this film,actor and producer Aamir Khan.Aamir Khan\\nabsolutely lived his character as Bhuvan throughout this film.He has\\noutclassed himself in this film.The film showcased his full acting\\npotential and great credit has to go to the director for pulling this\\noff.His eyes in this film were razor sharp absolutely piercing through\\nthe lenses directly into the hearts of the audience.The dialogue\\ndelivery by him was simply hard hitting an sitting in the hearts of\\nthose watching.Hats off.The other actors Gracy and Rachel did an\\noutstanding job in portraying the characters.Other smaller characters\\nreally made a standout performance throughout the film as well.The\\npeople in the village and the British actors completely gave life to\\nand done justice to the roles given by the director.They acted their\\nhearts out. A.R Rahman the two time Academy award winner in 2008,yet\\nagain proved why the Oscar\\'s needed him in 2002 itself.The background\\nscore of this film was absolutely a bliss to hear and in a class on its\\nown.This was one of the very few Indian films where I enjoyed every\\nsingle song because of its inspiring and spirit lifting lyrics,my\\npersonal favorite in \"Mitwa\".Some songs made me laugh and some made me\\ncry.The only reason has to be the hearty composition of a man who had\\nhis full dedication,hats off for this gem.

       " u\"\\nGreat movie of all times in Bollywood. I like the actor Amir Khan, he\\nactually blends in with the hero's virtual life and shows it like a\\nreality. The story line was also ultimate.

He has shown its dedication towards Bollywood cinema and which shows.\\nHe caters his movies to have a social moral or a thought to the movie\\nwhich generally now the movies lacks. I really enjoys his movies specially now a days because he is now very\\nparticular with the choice of his movies and script.Thanks\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nI recommend this filmThe film has more positive than negative . The sc\\xe9nario is found and\\nits history. The r\\xe9alisateur shows us the injustice for British\\ncolonized India. It is interesting to make a film on this subject with\\ncricket.For positives:I find that the main character has charisma : brave ; strong ;\\nintelligent. I find lively music. The film is a mixture of drama , love\\nand competition. In this film , we get attached to the different\\ncharacter with each character. Is the first film that i watch\\nBollywood.For negatives:The film is good but it is a bit too long. It is mostly in the middle\\nof the film does not happen much and that they are boring... I liked\\nthe movie ends badly : that British win facing the people. It would\\nhave allowed us to understand the pain of the people who were colonized\\nat the same time in 1893.In conclusion , i found this film good but with elements to change.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThis classic cult movie is about a conflict between the Indian farmers\\nlow class and higher class British men. But the new is the perspective\\nand it bring life to each character.

And by\\nthat time the first time producer Aamir Khan has faith and belief and\\nthis story and investing all he could to make it as director Ashutosh\\nwanted it. The music is excellent. Ten years later it still is one of\\nthe best soundtracks of Indian cinema and I think It will get still\\nbetter. No matter which country are you from, please watch this movie,\\nyou wont be disappointed. This movie showcases human spirit.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nWow. This film really deserved an Oscar. Because this film is the\\ndefinition of a perfect film. And not the masala type of commercially\\n\"perfect\" film, but the perfect film from a cinematic experience point\\nof view. It has everything. First off, a great and inspiring story that\\nfeatures Indian villagers facing cruel and unfair Britishers in a game\\nof cricket, which is something the villagers have no experience of. If\\nthe Indian villagers win, they are free of the British in their area\\nand the enormous and painful land taxes they must pay. This story was\\ninspiring and very exciting to watch and gripped me till the end. I\\ncheered when India was saved in the end by the catch that didn\\'t count.\\nSecond, the performances. Aamir Khan was magnificent. He played his\\ncharacter with so much passion and intensity. This was truly one of his\\nfinest performances. Also, the lead actress Gracy Singh did great and\\nalso showed that she has the skills to be a fine actress. The rest of\\nthe cast, including the British actors, also had powerful performances.\\nAnd the third reason this movie was great is that it had everything.\\nDrama, romance, action, thrill, intensity, great music, powerful and\\nintense performances, and great direction by Ashutosh Gowariker that\\nmade one of the most gripping and inspiring stories come so finely onto\\nthe screen. Also, A.R. Rahman\\'s soundtrack was beautiful; one of the\\nbest soundtracks in Bollywood history. His music helped add to the\\nfilm\\'s emotions. This movie deserved all the awards it got and also\\ndefinitely deserved an Oscar. Overall, I would rate this film a 10 out\\nof 10 and recommend anyone to surely watch this masterpiece!\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThis movie is widely regarded as one of the greatest Bollywood movies\\nof all time and it definitely deserves that recognition. The scope,\\nproduction budget and attention to detail were unprecedented for the\\ntime in which it was released. Apart from that, the natural\\nperformances given by the actors make the movie one to remember. The\\nruntime of the movie is absolutely huge but surprisingly passes by in a\\nbreeze. The wonderful soundtrack composed by A.R. Rahman is one of the\\nbest ever and it complements the movie beautifully. Aamir Khan shows\\nthat he is one of the most talented actors in India and always chooses\\nhis movies wisely. I hope that other filmmakers take inspiration from\\nthis movie and try to make more such movies which show the real India.\\nA must watch for all cinema-goers.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nThis work of art is a film of childhood memory. Loved the great amount\\nof emotional depth portrayed by Aamir Khan in the way it was required.\\nThe bar was set high and he achieved it through working all of the\\nother characters into his as if he knew them for years. The\\ncinematography when Paul Blackthorne catches the ball to the slow pan\\ndownwards really captured the hearts of the audience. These scenes are\\nmemorable forever for the ones who went through these harsh times in\\nIndia. This film's cast from the baby face of the protagonist and the\\nfierce look in the eyes of Paul Blackthorne. Great movie! Must see film\\nif you're an Indian. Drama packed action with some romantic love\\nreminiscing behind the tragedy.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\"Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India\" is an Indian musical movie in which\\nwe watch the people of a small village in Victorian India try to\\nsurvive due to difficult circumstances. In these difficulties came one\\nmore about the taxes and everything will be judged on a game of cricket\\nbetween the locals and the British.I liked this movie because it was something different for me and I\\nfound it very interesting and beautiful. I also liked this movie\\nbecause of the plot and the storyline. The direction which made by\\nAshutosh Gowariker was magnificent and equally good was the music and\\ndancing. About the interpretations I have to mention the interpretation\\nof Aamir Khan who played as Bhuvan and he was simply outstanding. Some\\nother interpretations that have to be mentioned are Paul Blackthorne\\'s\\nwho played as Captain Andrew Russell and of course the beautiful\\'s\\nRachel Shelley\\'s who played as Elizabeth Russell.Finally I have to say that \"Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India\" is a\\nvery interesting movie to watch because it shows what happened to India\\nin the Victorian times. What difficulties Indian people got through and\\nhow were their lives back then. Musical movies are different than the\\nclassic movies but I believe that this movie is not just a musical\\nmovie because it teaches us many things about India and its culture.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nThis is my First Review for a movie. Although I don't have much emotion\\nand time to write a review I think this movie deserved to be known from\\nthe eyes of the biggest Fan. The movie is an Epic and I considered it\\nas my top 5 favorite of all time.(The Godfather, The shawshank\\nRedemption, The Dark Knight,Fight Club are other four.) The Movie is\\nunderrated because of its limitation to receive global Viewership. It\\ndeserved to nominate for Oscar more than most of the movies that have\\nbeen nominated. The plot is epic and the actors have played there part very well. The\\nmusic by A.R Rahman and the Lyrics by Javed Akhtar is extra Ordinary.\\nThe kind of sentiments we have for cricket, Social discrimination, Love\\nTriangle have been depicted in an fabulous way. The movie captures the\\nheart of India and for me is the best Indian movie ever been made.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nAs it was directed by Ashutosh Govarikar, there is no doubt from\\nwatching the movie. As the Lagaan tells about kind of true stories that\\nhad ever been happening in India when it was ruled by British\\ngovernment, it makes feel to be on real world living. When in the\\nmiddle the movie feels to be slow but it has to be as the directed\\ntried to be realistic. Lagaan is the story of those people who were\\ncondemned brutally by British Govt. Songs of these movies are\\neuphonious. It is the music direction by A.R. Rehman-who is one of best\\nmusic director all over the world. He has already been applauded with\\nas Oscar. And the reputed singers-Lata Mangeshkar, Udit Narayan, Asha\\nBhosale, Sukhwinder Singh make these songs more melodious. And the\\nlyricist- Javed Akhtar made the wonderful combination of words which\\nmade song worthwhile ever.The captain's sister plays a wonderful role.\\nShe not only sacrifice her relations with her family and British govt\\nbut also the love with the Indian superstar. Over all i loved the movie\\nas it is.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThe year is 1893 in a small village in the heart of India. A British\\nCantonment bordered the village. They protect the local Raja from\\nneighboring Rajas as well as the other Rajas. So they are able to\\ndemand Lagaan (tax) from the hard-upon local villagers. There is a\\ndrought but the cruel arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul\\nBlackthorne) doesn't care and doubles the Lagaan. Local villager Bhuvan\\n(Aamir Khan) rallies the villagers to appeal to the Raja. There they\\nwitness their first game of cricket played by the British. Russell\\noffers to forgive the Lagaan for the entire province for the next three\\nyears if Bhuvan can lead a team to beat the British. If the villagers\\nlose, he will triple the Lagaan. Few villagers believe in the gamble\\nexcept for Gauri (Gracy Singh) who loves Bhuvan. The captain's sister\\nElizabeth (Rachel Shelley) comes to teach the hopeless villagers how to\\nplay the foreigner's game.Indian movies are not usually my thing but this one works very well.\\nI'm still not a big fan of the Bollywood song and dance. However the\\nstory works here. The Captain is a bit of a cartoon who needs to be a\\nbetter villain. The love story is good but the love triangle needs to\\nhold off its resolution. The game is pretty much a Bad News Bear\\nsituation where all the disparate players join together. The game is\\ninteresting. They made it compelling and almost understandable.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nThis is an enjoyable Bollywood sports epic which celebrates the victory\\nof a ragtag bunch of Indian villagers in cricket against British army\\nofficers in late 19th century India. The cricket match is long but\\nnever boring and there's a surprising amount of tension generated even\\nthough the outcome is never in doubt . Alas, the script paints the\\nBrits as black-hearted villains. They are practically caricatures hell\\nbent on abusing the native population. Still, the film works well,\\nthanks to the strong lead performances. Aamir Khan is effective as the\\nhero Bhuvan who challenges the English.Overall 7/10\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nA must watch movie for all Indians since we're such cricket buffs. An\\nepic colonial tale of a challenge taken by a group of Indian villagers\\nto get away without paying taxes, in the form of a cricket match\\nagainst a team formed by the British officers.These rural people are barely acquaint with the basics of the sport,\\nhowever, a win against all odds happens to be their only chance to\\nbattle through a period of unrelenting drought..what else do you want\\nfor a reason to like this movie..legendary stuff..When you look at the storyline which was arguably based on a true story\\nas well, and the way it was directed, it surely stands out as one of\\nthem movies, which changed the way movies were made in India, with a\\ngreater sense of purpose and motive being instilled in our system to\\nraise the barriers that long denied Indian movies, the international\\nfame. A testament to this is that since then, a number of Indian movies\\nhave won hearts abroad, and I'm sure that awards will follow suit..Nominated for Oscar, and in all fairness it deserved to be, as well,\\nand though the award was nicked by another deserving movie, the\\nadrenaline it pumped into the Indian cinema was a far greater\\nachievement, and the change that it brought about, may win us many\\nOscars in future..\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nThe price of making a four hour film is that of having a much more\\ndifficult time holding the attention of your audience for its full\\nruntime. In the case of Asutosh Gowariker\\'s 2001 epic, Lagaan: Once\\nUpon A Time In India, it is rare to at any point have such a thought of\\nlosing interest in the cleverly crafted Bollywood film. Gowariker pays\\nspecial attention to each and every shot as if it were its own\\ninnovative painting making sure there is always an array of activity to\\nkeep one\\'s eye active.Lagaan tells the story of a poverty-stricken Hindu town that is\\nstruggling to cope with the oppression and high lagaan taxes of the\\nBritish Raj. Upon the initiation of a further increase in the tax, the\\npeasants begin to speak out begging for the tax to be lowered. In\\nresult, the British officers lend the proposition of a cruel\\nintended-deal; a game of cricket will be held between the British\\nofficers and peasants. If the peasants succeed in victory they are\\nexempt of any taxes for the next 3 years, if they lose, they will pay\\ntriple lagaan. This erupts into a predictable yet touching Hindu\\nrendition of The Mighty Ducks from this point on.Although the story is clich\\xe9 and somewhat overdone, it remains fresh to\\nthe naked eye due to the remarkable design outside of the script\\nitself. Aamir Khan presents a beautifully performed display as Bhuvan,\\nthe only initial peasant to stand up for his community against the\\nBritish. The supporting cast accents Khan to an ideal level as well,\\nmost notably Paul Blackthorne in the dark and immoral role of Captain\\nRussell who plays the antagonist of this film with a respectable\\nconviction and stereotypical \"bad-guy waxed moustache.\"This is a visual masterpiece as well composed of gorgeous sweeping\\nshots and vivid color which never seems to fall off the deep end as too\\n\"cartoony.\" Somewhere at about an hour into this drama, we see a\\nmusical spontaneously erupt which is covered in long shots opposed to a\\nmontage style- an interesting approach to musical numbers in film. Down\\nto the bone, this is a very typical film portrayed in a completely\\ninnovative and well-done way; the writing is beautiful throughout as\\nare the performance. It\\'s painful but honest to say that this film\\novercomes its shallowness by being simply \"really damn entertaining.\"\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nIf you\\'ve never seen an Indian movie - I\\'ve only seen a few - then\\n\"Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India\" should give you a good inkling.\\nThis story of the Indian people\\'s resistance to colonialism (in the\\nform of a cricket game) goes over the top in just about every way. As\\nis often the case in Hindi films, the characters break out into song at\\none point. I also noticed that the Indians call the English \"ferengi\"\\n(like on \"Star Trek\"); I think that the word might mean \"foreigner\" in\\nHindi.Overall, this is a fine piece of work from the subcontinent, and I\\ncertainly recommend it. I haven\\'t seen enough Indian movies to\\ndetermine if this is among the greatest, but it definitely makes one\\nappreciate the work coming from Bollywood. Starring Aamir Khan, Gracy\\nSingh, Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\"Lagaan\" takes place in India, in a small village, ruled by the\\nBritish, which is facing a drought due to the lack of rain because\\nthere hasn\\'t been any monsoons. The lack of rain led to the loss of\\nmany crops. Even worse Captain Russell, a British captain, decides to\\nraise the land tax also known as the Lagaan. This becomes even more\\nimpossible for the villagers to pay so they try to talk things out with\\nCaptain Russell. Captain Russell, knowing that the villagers have no\\nclue about the game or Cricket, he challenges them to a game and gives\\nthem a few months to practice. If they win, they don\\'t have to pay the\\nLagaan, but if they lose, they have to pay even more. Bhuvan takes up\\nthe challenge and gathers up a team. Bhuvan and his team is then aided\\nby Elizabeth Russell, Captain Russell\\'s sister. While all of this is\\ngoing on, the movie is also a love story. Bhuvan is in love with one of\\nthe villagers named Gauri. Gauri then gets a bit jealous of the\\nrelationship between Bhuvan and Elizabeth.The acting in \"Lagaan\" was very good. At sometimes a little over\\ndramatic but I think that added some comedy to the film. The set design\\nwas also very good. It portrayed the drought that the villagers had to\\nlive through. Their clothing showed their religion and social class on\\nthe Caste system. I think one of the strengths of the movie was\\ndefinitely the directing. Ashutosh Gowariker did a very good job in\\ngetting my attention during dramatic scenes my zooming in on the\\nactors\\' and actress\\' faces and actions. This was great especially\\nduring the Cricket game. The addition of background music made the\\nmovie even better, adding excitement and a little suspense to the\\nmovie.I give \"Lagaan\" eight out of ten stars. I think the movie was great but\\njust too long for me, even though I expected it to be that long because\\nthat is the average length of a Bollywood movie. Another characteristic\\nof Bollywood movies I\\'m not really a big fan of was the musical\\nnumbers. Even though it went along with the movie, it still felt a\\nlittle random for me because people don\\'t usually sing and dance\\nrandomly in real life. I\\'m sure if you\\'re a fan of Bollywood movies,\\nyou would like the movie more than I did and most likely gave it ten\\nstars.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nWould you be willing to put your life on the line on a single match of\\nbaseball? One courageous Bollywood star would. Amir Khan plays Bhuvan\\nin the movie \"Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India.\" When a pushover\\nBritish Captain, Captain Russell, messes with a small village,\\nChampaneer, by challenging them to a game of Cricket, Bhuvan accepts\\nthe challenge on behalf of the village. The only consequence to losing\\nthis match would be to pay triple Lagaan, or tax, which was paid in\\nfood. This movie offers a suspenseful plot full of drama, music,\\nromance, and action. The movie is very interesting in itself, but it\\'s\\nalso pretty predictable.\"Lagaan\" takes place in Colonial India, not present day. Most of the\\ncommon folk were poor farmers. The monsoons where late that year,\\ncausing the villagers to grow little crop to pay their Lagaan to the\\ngovernment, even for themselves to survive. The living conditions are\\nvery believable as the setting matches the dessert environment\\nperfectly for a poor Indian farmer. Captain Russell, played by Paul\\nBlackthorne, is the collector of these taxes and wishes only to have\\npower. Bhuvan first encounters the captain during a hunting scene when\\nhe is scaring off the animals so they don\\'t get killed. Captain Russell\\nrecognizes him as a threat and so challenges him and village to a game\\nof cricket. There was already a double Lagaan placed, and so the wager\\nwas if the villagers win they don\\'t have to pay lagan for three year.\\nHowever, if they lose they must pay triple lagan for this year, which\\nwould cause the village to starve to death. Bhuvan bravely accepts the\\nchallenge even though he doesn\\'t know how to play the game, as he\\nthought he did. The villagers where a little upset for placing such a\\nwager, but Captain Russells sister, Elizabeth, played by Rachel Shelly,\\nsaw the unfairness of her brother and offered to teach them the game.\\nThe story gets dramatic and even comical as Bhuvan rounds up his\\nplayers. Bhuvan is the main unifier as he breaks Indian tradition and\\nsets aside the caste system and accepts a Muslim. The plot gets really\\nsuspenseful as the game starts and the underdog rises gradually. The\\ngame comes close towards the end and both teams are nervous.This Bollywood movie shows a great deal of Indian culture through\\nmusicals and in the storyline itself. The story seems possible but not\\nlikely. However, it\\'s very entertaining and suspenseful. If the movie\\nwere cutoff, you\\'d be upset because you want to know what happens next.\\nEven though the storyline may have a predictable plot, the director\\narranges it so things get interesting, such as an untouchable, lower\\ncaste member, joins the team. Over it\\'s a great movie and I recommend\\nit as an exciting movie. I give it an eight out of ten stars.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nThe idea of sitting through a 3 3/4-hour film about a cricket match\\ndidn\\'t appeal to me until I read the reviews for this 2001 Indian\\nextravaganza set in rural 1893 British colonial-ruled India. It\\'s\\nreally the only home-grown Bollywood film I\\'ve ever seen if you don\\'t\\ncount Gurinder Chadha\\'s disappointing multi-cultural Jane Austen\\nadaptation, 2004\\'s \"Bride and Prejudice\". The film\\'s title, \"Lagaan\",\\nrefers to the annual crop tax charged by the British army to the\\nprovincial Rajah, who in turn, must collect the lagaan from the local\\nvillagers.The plot begins with a drought which has hit the village making it\\nnear-impossible for them to pay the lagaan. The cruel, capricious\\nCaptain Russell is indifferent to the fate of the villagers and decides\\nto charge double-lagaan. The villagers plead with the Rajah to cancel\\nthis year\\'s lagaan in deference to the drought, so the captain proposes\\na challenge that will either wipe out the lagaan for the next three\\nyears or force the villagers to pay triple-lagaan at once. The\\nchallenge takes the form of a cricket match between the local British\\ncommand and a ragtag team of villagers organized and led by a renegade\\nvillager, the hot-tempered Bhuvan.The middle of the film focuses on two plot strands - the local team\\'s\\nhaphazard preparation for the match aided by Russell\\'s sympathetic\\nsister Elizabeth, and the romantic triangle that develops between\\nBhuvan, Elizabeth and Gauri, the local girl smitten since childhood\\nwith Bhuvan. Amazingly, about eighty minutes of the final portion are\\ntaken up by the cricket match itself in painstaking detail. Even if you\\nknow nothing about the rules of the game (as I don\\'t), it is inarguably\\nthe best part of the movie. Granted there is little suspense in the\\noutcome and cricket is not the most visual of sports, director Ashutosh\\nGowariker makes the extended sequence exciting in spite of itself\\nthanks to the creative ways he develops the drama of the match.The rest of the film is a bit more variable, especially the rather slow\\nset-up of the story, but as a whole, the movie is enlivened by the\\ninevitable Bollywood production numbers. Unlike \"Bride\", the numbers\\nare not interjected as pure kitsch but feed more organically into the\\nplot. What also helps is A.R. Rahman\\'s atmospheric music. One should\\nunderstand from the outset that this is not a movie of great emotional\\ncomplexity or dramatic subtlety. Almost every aspect of the film is\\nvery in-your-face, and for the most part, the acting reflects such a\\ntone. However, the disparate elements somehow hold together, and\\nGowariker manages the even rarer feat of making the nearly four-hour\\nrunning time fly by.Aamir Khan is a charismatic presence as Bhuvan, and Gracy Singh is\\ncertainly pleasing enough as Gauri. Whether forcing the Rajah to eat\\nmeat or beating down a villager, Russell is played with such\\nmoustache-twirling excess by Paul Blackthorne that his unrepentant\\nvillainy becomes laughable along the lines of Snidely Whiplash. Rachel\\nShelley, bearing a certain resemblance to Courtney Cox, fares better as\\nElizabeth, though her character seems frustratingly passive despite her\\nbold efforts to help the villagers. Suhasini Mulay lends dignity to her\\nrole as Bhuvan\\'s mother, as does Kulbhushan Kharbanda as the Rajah.Each of the Indian players makes individual impressions, the most\\naffecting being the crippled untouchable Kachra (played poignantly by\\nAditya Lakhia), at first rejected and then embraced because his palsied\\narm provides an unhittable corkscrew throw. Special mention should be\\ngiven to Anil Mehta\\'s sun-drenched cinematography which captures the\\nrural landscape well. The DVD includes filmographies for the\\nprincipals, but of more interest is the eighteen-minute deleted scene\\nwhich shows more explicitly Elizabeth\\'s efforts to help the team and\\nher growing infatuation with Bhuvan. Even with its predictable story\\nand relatively shallow characters, the film bursts with such energy and\\nhistorical detail that it is well worth sitting through the lengthy\\nrunning time.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nLagaan, a tale of survival, struggle, love and courage and for those of\\nyou who have heard this too often it adds a twist \\x96 a cricket match\\nbetween two particularly different cultures in mind, traditions and\\ntechniques. Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India, directed by Ashutosh Gowariker and\\nstarring Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh, Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne\\nis a movie that not only invites viewers of different cultures, as can\\nbe seen by the variety of both Indian and British actors, but also\\nviewers of different ages. Rated PG for the lack of any sexual content\\nand only minor violence, not only can adults and teenagers appreciate\\nthe lessons and stories of love and life, but children can enjoy the\\npreparations to and final game of cricket. A runtime of 224 minutes\\nencompass a wide array of genres including drama and romance, musical\\nand sport. This story begins and ends in the village of Champaneer, with the fate\\nof the villagers\\' lives resting on a game of cricket. British\\noccupation of India during this time brings forth the conflict the\\nvillagers face: the Lagaan, a tax the Raja must pay for British\\nservices. The villagers, who provide the Raja with crops for the tax,\\npray for rain but their prayers go unanswered as the Lagaan threatens\\nhunger and despair upon the entire village. Only Bhuvan (Aamir Khan)\\nhas the courage to stand up to British official Capt. Russell (Paul\\nBlackthorne) who offers a game of cricket in return for the repeal of\\nthe Lagaan for three years, but if the British win the Lagaan will be\\ntripled. With tension already inflamed between the Indians and British,\\nBhuvan and the villagers form a family, using each individual\\'s talents\\nto learn a game they\\'ve never played so that they could win life. Even\\nElizabeth (Rachel Shelley), the British sister of Capt. Russell, joins\\nthis family in hopes of helping them and finds herself in a love\\ntriangle between herself, Bhuvan and Gauri (Gracy Singh), a young\\nIndian girl. When the day of the game comes you\\'re left wondering\\nwhether spirits will be revived or broken for the Indian village.Even though at first I was frightened to learn the movie was about\\nthree and a half hours long, I have to say as a viewer I did not feel\\nthem. Not only is the script historically accurate and both humorous\\nand dramatic at the right moments, the plot keeps you guessing, waiting\\nthe entire movie. An easy story to follow, the director provides just\\nthe right amount of suspense and relief to keep you going. The director\\nI believe is a master of the camera as he uses various camera angles to\\nget the viewers to feel what he intends, using both \"bird\\'s-eye\" views\\nas well as views from the ground and many more. Visually stunning, the\\nsettings and costumes were amazing from a gorgeous sunset emphasized by\\nGauri\\'s sari to a dance number in the pitch black, gorgeous all the\\nmore due to the bright costumes of the women. The musicals were my\\nfavorite: stunning performances and beautiful voices but for those of\\nyou not interested in dance, the cricket game is just as intense and do\\nnot worry if you\\'re foreign to the game: so are they. Lastly, I applaud\\nthe acting simply because they were able to get across the true\\nelements of life: love, despair, happiness and hope.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI have seen many, many good movies, but I truly believe that Lagaan is\\nthe best. Aamir Khan's intensity on screen is virtually unparalleled,\\nwhile the Indian supporting actors provide magnificent performances\\nthat are hilariously clich\\xe9d and yet also human with a deep\\noriginality. The nearly four-hour running time hardly ever lags --\\nwhenever a scene begins to get slow, a huge song-and-dance number is\\njust around the corner. The musical numbers are all incredibly complex,\\nwith stunning choreography and vibrant, dramatic vocals. You don't have\\nto speak Hindi or even read the subtitles to want to laugh, dance or\\ncry. There are many Bollywood movies that make it hard to sit through\\nthe first hour due to poor acting and sappy content. Lagaan, from the\\nopening voice-over to the final moment of the big cricket match, simply\\nmakes you very, very happy.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nA master piece cleverly knitted with India\\'s undisputed pastime\\n(Cricket) and classical history (British Rule). Brought to life on a\\nhuge canvas which pictures the triumph of the meek over the powerful. A\\nvery David and Goliathian approach to a gentleman\\'s game ( as cricket\\nis most fondly addressed).A village pleads to their British command to\\nreduce the amount of food they have to give away in the form of tax,\\nbecause they don\\'t have enough for themselves. The British command\\ndecides to grant them their wish provided the village win against them\\nin a game of cricket. It\\'s a brilliant effort to bring Cricket to the\\nbig screen in a way the world has not seen. And that it did by\\ncrediting itself a nomination for the \"Best film in a Foreign Language\"\\ncategory at the Oscars.It\\'s an absolute joyride flaunting with a lot of\\nhuman emotions combined with a edge-of-the-seat finish. Great\\nentertainment and worth every moment you spend watching it.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThis Oscar nominated Bollywood Blockbuster is one of the best movies I\\nhave ever seen. I have not see Aamir Khan this good since the early 90s\\nbut he has produced a gem of a film. Lagaan is set in the late 1800s\\nand is about a love triangle involving an English lady and two Indian\\nvillagers. This might be a true story as the tag line is \"Once Upon a\\nTime in India\" I recommend that If you like cricket and understand\\nHindi then go and see it. A new face made her Bollwood debut in this\\nmovie\"Gracy Singh\" who was doing Indian soaps was called up to co-star\\nwith Aamir and acted excellently. Cricket is a big thing in the movie\\nas the future of the province that they live in is decided by a cricket\\nmatch between the Indian villagers with very little experience and an\\nEnglish team with plenty of match practise and experience.\\n',\n",

       " u\"\\nWell since I am an Indian and i am a big fan Sharuk Khan I vote this\\nmovie 10 stars.

They have to give the queen\\ntwice the tax as much as they collect. After the raja of India arrives\\nto their town the Indians go and beg them to reduce taxes. The raja\\ndoes not say anything but one of the British cricket players that they\\nwill make a deal. That the Indians should play the British in a 4 day\\nmatch and if the Indians win they don't have to pay any taxes for 3\\nyears but if they lose they have to pay triple the tax then they used\\nto before.The Indians have never played cricket before and don't know\\nhot to play...\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nNothing compares to the success of the human spirit, especially under\\ntyranny.  ...and thats what this film is all about.Its 1893, the location is a remote village in Rajasthan, an historic state\\nin Northwestern India.

Lagaans story, on the other hand,\\ncontains many human emotions - love, lust, ego, jealousy, rage, sympathy\\nand, of course, ambition.  The plot is laid our well ...and scenes that\\nshow\\nthe careless lack of respect of the British Officer for the \"Rajah\\'s\"\\nobservance of vegetarianism to the curiosity of Indian villagers when they\\nfirst see the Brits playing cricket... guarantee you an insider\\'s view of\\nthe clash of cultures taking shape in a cricket game.\\nEnjoy!\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI decided to comment after I\\'ve read the other comments. Most of the\\ncomments were by well informed westerners; I felt the views of a\\nreasonably\\nwell informed Indian might be useful.The producers claim that the movie is based on a real incident that\\nhappened\\nin the late 19th century; I don\\'t know if this is true. What was\\ndefinitely\\nheartening is that they made an attempt to make the movie fairly\\nauthentic-looking - by hiring real western actors rather than fair skinned\\nIndians wearing blue contact lenses to play the British roles, daring to\\nhave the chracters speak in English rather than accented Hindi, and more\\nthan adequate efforts at creating the period atmosphere. These had been\\nlacking generally in Indian movies. There are of course exceptions like\\n\"Shatranj ke Khiladi\", but then it is made by Ray.The first part of the movie is very good, in spite of the usual Hindi\\nmovie\\ncliches. They have handled the script very well. Overall the movie is\\ndefinitely too long & I found the second part dragging & full of sporting\\ncliches, but I could clearly see the rest of the audience hugely enjoying\\nit.It is definitely a very clever box-office idea - it has cricket,\\nnationalism, and the evil British officer who gets beaten at his own game\\n(both literally & figuratively)! But this is a very positive movie, and\\nthis\\nis what I like most about it. It shows how confidence, enthusiasm planning\\nand hard work can win, and it shows it well. I think India needs more such\\nmovies - and then, so does the world.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI have just seen Lagaan on video (with English subtitles) and was absolutely\\namazed, especially about the great pacing of the movie. It didn\\'t drag for\\none minute, the four hours felt like one and a half. I was thoroughly\\nexcited and involved by this film all the time.I have become interested in Bollywood films recently and have seen some (as\\nwell as some extracts) and I must say that this one was at the same time 100\\n% Bollywood - but still different. It left out all the annoying Bollywood\\nclich\\xe9s (the hero beating up some bad guys, the hero and heroine dancing in\\nthe Swiss mountains) and had a decent screenplay where it was the story that\\nmattered most and not the music scenes. And the production standards\\n(especially of the dialogue bits) weren\\'t as annoyingly low as in many other\\nB. films, but nearly equalled those of Hollywood (except for the\\ncomputer-generated clouds which were rather ridiculous).This is of course a very archetypal story where there were the Good and the\\nBad, and the small ones beating the big one, but it was thoroughly enjoyable\\nand never got annoying. I normally get bored by the average Hollywood sports\\nmovie, but this one kept me clutching my seat during the cricket scenes\\n(even though I hadn\\'t had the least idea about cricket before seeing this\\nmovie).The love triangle was quite funny, I especially loved the taboo situation of\\nthe rich white lady lusting for the Indian peasant...\\n(It must really be said that Aamir Khan was EXTREMELY sexy in this movie!!!\\n:))\\nFunniest of all was the song scene of the three main characters, the bit\\nthat was most \"bollywoodish\" in my opinion. Most of all, because Bollywood\\nlove song scenes are in most cases \"only\" the picturisation of fantasies.\\nThis also became clear here (at least, in part) because this was the only\\nscene where Rachel Shelley was not wearing 19th century clothes, but rather\\nred veils blown by the wind, showing her desire for Bhuvan - or in another\\nscene she was lying in his arms on the porch of his house, wearing a\\nsari...\\nI especially loved the bit in this song where Bhuvan and Elizabeth dance\\ntogether in a Western ballroom, Bhuvan wearing an English uniform - but also\\nstill his quite prominent earrings... :)I am happy that so many people here seem to have found interest in watching\\nBollywood movies after seeing this one, but please, don\\'t have too high\\nexpectations: you\\'ll have to search for a long time before finding anything\\nas good as this one here. Though there are lots of good non-Bollywood Indian\\nfilms, Bollywood unfortunately hardly ever reaches the standards of this\\nmovie - though things are improving. I hope that Lagaan will get a large\\naudience worldwide - and also come to Austria. (It is now shown in both\\nGermany and Switzerland, but unfortunately not here - yet.)\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nAs a teenager, occasionally I read books which were set in India (i.e., the\\nFar Pavilions). I watched \"The Jewel in the Crown\" from beginning to end,\\nand after that \"A Passage to India\", \"Heat and Dust\" and others. All\\ndifferent films but with one thing in common; all from the\\nBritish/Colonial/white point of view.Expanding my horizons to the Indian experience outside of India, I sought\\nout films like \"My Beautiful Launderette\" and \"Mississippi Masala\". I had\\nalso seen a couple of Indian independent films, like \"Salaam Bombay\" and\\n\"Kama Sutra\", but I had never seen a full-out Bollywood production before. I\\nadded \"Lagaan\" to my Netflix queue based, in part, on an Oscar nomination\\nand on a favorable essay about the film on National Public Radio\\'s \"All\\nThings Considered\". In the time between placing it in the queue and actually getting the film, I\\nsaw \"Ghost World\" where, in one scene, Enid was watching a clip from a Hindi\\nmusical, which to my WASP ears, sounded like Chinese opera on speed. And\\nthen on top of that, I found out that \"Lagaan\" was over 3 \\xbd hours long! The\\nDVD arrived and I thought seriously about returning it unviewed, but I\\ndidn\\'t, and I\\'m glad I didn\\'t. IT WAS WONDERFUL. Engaging, uplifting and\\nbest of all, entertaining, and it passed the \"butt\" test (I didn\\'t feel the\\nneed to squirm not once during the entire running time). And it didn\\'t hurt\\nthat the star, Aamir Khan is a major babe. All in all, a great film for the whole family with valuable lessons in\\ntolerance, integrity and cooperation surrounded by an entertaining\\nmovie.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nthis movie runs 225 minutes and I loved every second of it. the Hindus\\nreally know how to get your attention, and glue you to your seat. i\\nforgot everything while watching it, even my chain-smoking addiction. go\\nsee it, and don\\xb4t forget other masterpieces like MONSOON WEDDING and\\nABHAY!\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nsince the movie clocks in at around four hours and I payed exactly four\\ndollars to get into it, I had precisely 1 hour per dollar.  And i did\\nindeed\\nget my penny\\'s worth.  I was skeptical about the whole viewing experience,\\nhaving been mainly pulled into the theater by a friend of mine, but i was\\nnot dissapointed.  The film concerns a group of indian civilians trying to\\nstand their own against a rotten old british tyrant.  The colors and the\\ncinematography are gorgeous, as is the fluid motions of the camera.  The\\nmusical numbers are stunningly choreographed and their style stands up\\nagainst any music video you could name.  The length of the film also does\\nnot detract from its viewing enjoyment.  There are no real bland points or\\nunnecessary tangent plotlines.  Although there was an intermission held at\\nthe showing I went to, it felt largely unneeded and was the only point when\\nthe action of this bollywood epic broke.The film does have its weak points however.  I am not entirely convinced\\nthat had the film plot removed itself from early 21th century india to\\n1950\\'s hollywood, that this would have been another busby berkely forgotten\\nyawknfest.  The script is pretty much predicatable and clich\\xe9d.  Any one\\nwho\\'s seen a sports movie knows the basic outline of how the big game will\\ngo.  Any one who\\'s seen a love story knows where that will go.  The female\\nleads are also kind of one-dimensional and boring. It is a movie\\nexclusively\\ndriven by the men, which seems unfair since the love triangle appears to be\\na big part of the plot.  The villian of the film also seems intolerably\\nawful.  There is absolutely no sympathy for his actions, he seems to simply\\nact out some nihilist Iago power-trip fantasy.  The fact that the other\\nelite Brits accept and laud him for that behavior without any insight into\\nmotivation seems a little trite.  The film also gleefully throws around the\\nterm \"Whitey\" describing the british, which comes off a tad\\nracist.However, these are points that can be looked past to see what might be the\\n\"titanic\" of the indian cinema (rather than the \"crouching tiger\").  It\\'s\\nfully entertaining, pretty, and upbeat.  Bring the kids.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nYou could say \"Lagaan\" is India\\'s answer to \"Moulin Rouge\", but obviously,\\nMr. Baz Luhrmann has drawn inspiration from these films than the other way\\naround.The story of a Hindu\\'s (Aamir Khan, who also produced) village\\'s fight to\\nkeep from paying the British government any taxes (lagaan) for three years\\nif they win a cricket match, (similar to Peter Cattaneo\\'s \"The Full Monty\")\\nis heartwarming, as it is topical. The gorgeous Indian landscape is put to\\nwonderful use; as is the scintillating song-and-dance numbers. It\\'s also\\naided by some robust humor and a steamy triangular romance.Even at 3 and a 1/2 hours, this film has sustained my interest. It also\\nraised my interest in the \"Bollywood\" genre, and I hope it does with you\\ntoo.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nwhat a fantastic movie. it is a microcosm of indian society mid-19th\\ncentury. the hero (bhuvan) accepts the challenge from the british colonial\\noverlords-- the annual tax (the lagaan) will be lifted for 3 years if the\\nindians beat the british in a cricket match. if the british win the tax is\\ntripled which will ruin the native population, their grip on survival is\\ntenuous at best. drought has ruined the harvests for two years (the \"black\\ncloud\" musical production is most entertaining, filled energy & joy). the\\nvillagers are amazed & very angry when bhuvan accepts the challenge to\\nlearn\\ncricket and THEN play the british army. bhuvan builds a team the includes\\nhindus, a moslem, a member of the \\'untouchable\\' caste, a shik and a lovely\\nenglish women. elizabeth is willing to teach the natives the\\ngame,demonstrating an real affinity & love for the indian people & for\\nbhuvan. the plot is rife with nationalism, unrecoited love,\\nboy-meets-girl,\\nracial tensions, religious fervor, class struggles & great musical\\nnumbers.\\nthe four hours just flew-by. there is no sex, no violence -- this is\\nsimply\\na wonderful movie. well acted. most entertaining.\\n',\n",

Bhuwan, the simple village youth who has\\nnever even heard of the game cricket which is so much popular with his\\ncolonial masters, takes on the angry Capt. Andrew Russell in this alien\\ngame, only in order to save his village, as-well-as the other villages in\\nthat province, from the almost impossible task of paying taxes during a\\nprolonged drought period, when there's hardly any food for anyone.Aamir Khan, who can easily be named the best actor in Bollywood, has dared\\nto make a brilliant film on an unconventional theme. Bollywood, despite\\nhaving such a great mass-appeal, has always been very reluctant in handling\\nunconventional, unusual themes. But Khan, a pure perfectionist that he is,\\njust went ahead, and along with Ashutosh Gowariker, a film-maker who had so\\nfar been under-estimated, made a Lagaan which will stand as an example for\\nother producers and directors.Everything about Lagaan is worth-watching. Aamir Khan as Bhuwan and his ten\\ncomrades, played by actors of calibre like Raghuveer Yadav, Sri Vallabh\\nVyas, Amin Haji, Raj Zutshi, Pradeep Rawat and others are matchless.\\nDebutante Gracy Singh is wonderful as the village-belle Gauri who loves\\nBhuwan. She is a natural actress and more than that a wonderful dancer.\\nHer's is one of the best debut performances that Bollywood has seen.\\nHowever\\nGowariker should be praised for his terrific handling of the British cast.\\nPaul Blackthorne as the tyrant Capt. Russell is absolutely convincing.\\nRachel Shelley as the memsaab Elizabeth Russell looks stunning, and her\\nHindi is good. The sets are very rustic and very real and A. R. Rahman's\\nmusic gels with the narrative.A shouldn't-be-missed movie. An epic production. \\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI am sure all the lines on the comments by all are full of praise for\\nLagaan\\nthe film,team and Aamir.I did enjoy the film completely but would like to\\ncomment critically on the film.\\nA)Aamir shrewdly altered the storyline which was written/conceived by\\nAsh.Full marks to Aamir for making it crisp and evoking the best possible\\nemotions from audience till date in the history of Indian cinema but pt\\nmade\\nhere is great film makers like Bimal Roy,Guru dutt,Mehboob never shrewdly\\ncut the storyline to suit the market/or boxoffice.\\nB)In spite of great research claimed by Aamir n team they missed out one\\nfact\\nwhich can be pardoned compared to the zillions of those in other bollywood\\nflicks.\\nThe fact:-\\nThe story is set in 1868(something) and during the match theres a sequence\\nwhere Elizabeth comes in betn and argues about rules of crick in book\\nwhereby a particular style of bowling is being allowed,which is true as per\\nrecords.But the blunder is about the SIXER which Aamir hits in the end and\\nwins.The books of crick defined SIX as ball which filps across the\\nground/or\\npavilion without touching ground whereas any ball crossed directly over the\\nropes was used two be declared as four.So logically Lagaan team has lost\\nthe\\ngame and not won it.\\nAnyways hope they get an Oscar!!!.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nLAGAAN is undoubtedly one of the best Hindi (Bollywood) film in ages. Time\\nis not at all a barrier. It is worth the money. The film is not only about\\nthe much talked about cricket match. It is more than a cricket match.\\nCinematography sets the right mood for  the period. MUST SEE\\nfilm.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nI\\'ve just seen Lagaan in a fairly small house with an audience that seemed\\nto be about half Indian (broadly speaking) and half not. Everybody loved it,\\nincluding me. It didn\\'t seem four hours long, but then a game of cricket\\nlasts a lot longer and it was targetted at cricket fans. I\\'ve only seen one other Bollywood film ever, Jai Santoshi Ma, and that was\\non television  years ago. But I\\'ve read that they\\'ve become increasingly\\nless \"Indian\", and these days tend to focus on beautiful young people in an\\ninternational setting. Lagaan is quite the opposite, definitely set in rural\\nIndia, and it seems to follow the other conventions, for example, everyone\\nbursting into song and dance at key points, and a strong (but often\\nhumorous) background presence of Hindu deities. It differs from other,\\nolder, Bollywood films in that its theme is explicitly about spiritual\\nresistance to the British Empire. Its main appeal to me is that it brings out the emotional appeal of a lot\\nof different film genres in a coherent way. The central theme is the High\\nNoon style personal duel between Bhuvan, the dashing hero, and  Russell, the\\nstupid and nasty British soldier in charge of the garrison. But the clash of\\ncultures and good/evil around it is also pure Star Wars, and the way the\\ndifferent team members come together has a touch of Robin Hood (with\\nRussell\\'s honorable sister Elizabeth as Marian) or the Magnificent Seven, as\\nwell as of Jesus and the Apostles. The characters are appealing in\\nthemselves and plausible as a team. And the song-and-dance production\\nnumbers have an appeal of their own, especially the very funny one where\\nElizabeth sings in English in her boudoir while Bhuvan and his beloved Gauri\\ndo a more convention duet in the country side. What integrates all this is the cricket match, which provides a set of\\nsituations and rules for a conflict. There are a lot of cricket jokes (some\\nanachronistic or knowing) but it\\'s really more like an Ealing comedy where\\nthe spirit of the little guys makes them bigger than the powerful\\nguys.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis was the first Indian film I've seen, and I wasn't disappointed. I was a\\nlittle apprehensive about the 4-hour running time (the only other film of\\nthat length I've seen at the cinema was Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, and that\\nwasn't an experience I'd want to repeat) but in the end, I could have quite\\nhappily watched it for an hour longer. The actors were great, the depiction\\nof life in the village was realistic, and the landscapes and cinematography\\nwere stunning. And as for the costumes and the songs, they just got better\\nand better - I thought the song about Krishna was breathtaking, brilliantly\\nexecuted and just fantastic to watch. \\nBut best of all was the cricket match. As a cricket fan, I cannot begin to\\ndescribe how enjoyable this was. It was dramatic, touching, funny, sad, just\\ntotally engrossing - and it worked so well. Because we knew all eleven\\nmembers of the Indian team and their idiosyncracies, it was brilliant to see\\nhow their characters translated to their batting styles. I also loved the\\nway they were forced to learn about the game on the hoof eg when fielding\\nthe way that every member of the team chased the ball, until they realised\\nwhat they were doing wrong -  hilarious - and the way they brought the\\nspinner on at the start. Truly a great game, and a great\\nending!\\nMy only criticism of the film would be that to my mind the British actors\\ndidn't seem all that great - the way they played their parts was over the\\ntop and not particularly convincing, especially the Captain. But I noticed\\nthis less and less as the film went on.\\nAll in all a great experience - considering going again.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nLagaan is a refreshing movie from Bollywood. Aamir Khan and Ashutosh Gowariker have put in real effort to make a good\\nmovie. They deserve credit for recreating the emotional trauma of being\\nunder British rule and how a bunch of people courageously won over their\\nunfair rule. The cricket sequences are exceptionally well handled. Perhaps\\nthe only Indian film that captures cricket that well. However, I think these\\nsequences can be improved phenomenally - that way Ashutosh and Aamir can\\nturn totally brutal and leave the audience absolutely under their mercy - to\\nbe relieved from the ever growing suspense and excitement. Perhaps the rapid\\nadvances in Graphics can help. If Hollywood could recreate almost all of the\\ncoliseum in Gladiator [they only built a part of the coliseum, the rest was\\ndone by computer], cooking up some breath taking shots in cricket should be\\na piece of cake.Regarding the performances, Gracy Singh as Gowri excelled over everyone.\\nAamir\\'s performance seemed more like a supporting role. None of his\\nexpressions \"hit you\". Gracy\\'s do. The other performances are all adequate\\nto keep the movie going as intended.Song sequences deserve a special credit. After many many movies, there is a\\nmovie where the songs come naturally. You never feel a song was put just for\\nthe heck of it. Once the song starts, the choreography takes over. This is\\nanother excpetional aspect of the movie..the choreography is smooth and not\\nthe usual \"cut and paste\" stuff. The camera moves from one artist to another\\nin a seamless manner. \"Radha kaise na jale\" is my personal\\nfavorite.I personally think Sarfarosh was more \"cooler\" than this one. But both these\\nmovies clearly stand out to be one of the best one in the past 4 years -\\nalong with ofcourse, Satya. \\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nBut of course Aamir Khan produced and starred in it, would you have\\nexpected\\nany less?I don't know anything about cricket, I still loved this movie, for those\\npeople that think this movie is about cricket and don't know cricket, it's\\nNOT about cricket, it's a movie about the human spirit and it's ability to\\ntriumph even in the most hopeless situations.Go check it out, you will laugh and cheer. I felt more excitement and joy\\nwatching this movie than watching the Chicago Bulls play during the\\nplayoffs\\na few years ago. If you can understand that, you must realize how great\\nthis\\nmovie is.I can't wait to see Aamir Khan's next movie..\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nThe story is indeed a great one. Although it contains a somewhat\\noverwhelming hyperbolic, It should actually expected beforehand, due to\\nhyperbolas in the dramatization, even to some extremes, is to some\\nextent a distinctive signature of any Indian movie, beside the all\\nknown singing and dancing every thirty minutes or so. I personally\\ndon't think that the hyperbolic are really needed in this story because\\nit already is a great story to tell. Fortunately Aamir Khan realizes\\nthis and uses drastically reduced hyperbolas in the next works as 3\\nIdiots (2009). This movie is also able to teach at least the very basic\\nrules of cricket, a game which is not very common in countries outside\\nthe British Commonwealth. The acting is just what is expected from any\\nIndian movie. Not to say that it's bad, but I sure will not also say\\nthat it's Oscar quality. But then again I'm sure that, like most of\\nAamir Khan production, this movie's strong point is the great story\\nbased on a rare premise to be used as a movie screenplay. The set\\nselection unfortunately is very confined and limited for a movie with\\nalmost a three hour duration.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nA deeply spiritual movie with redemptive themes that captures the\\ncourage and determination of the human spirit, Lagaan will transport\\nyou to a time and place you'll wish you were part of. Can an Indian\\nmovie with subtitles hold your attention for nearly four hours? Our\\nfamily has watched the DVD so many times we've actually purchased our\\nsecond copy, and prefer to watch it in Hindi. The characters pull us\\nin, and we feel part of the community; which love story will prevail?\\nWill the subjugated and tyrannized be liberated? Will a seed of hope\\ngrow into victory? Set in rural India prior to gaining its independence\\nfrom Great Britain, this story weaves together characters from a local\\nBritish Cantonment, Indian Rajas (regional kings) and poor farmers\\nforced to pay 'Lagaan' or tax that has moved beyond burdensome to\\noppressive. Seizing an opportune moment, one of the members of a\\nvillage accepts a challenge from the British officer in charge: they\\nmust beat the British in their game of Cricket to be free of Lagaan for\\nthree years, or face triple the tax rate. The story unfolds as Bhuvan\\nconvinces members of his village to learn the game and confront the\\narrogant captain in a fight that for the village is not only about\\nwinning, but literally about survival.There is much to like about Lagaan. Of the many powerful scenes, some\\nwhich may have you on the edge of your seat, two in particular are\\ntranscendent. In order to complete the team, Bhuvan asks an 'outcast'\\nmember of the community to join. The other team members are indignant,\\nas the caste system seems this person as worthless scum and his\\npresence as polluting the 'system.' In a powerfully moving scene,\\nBhuvan makes a stirring speech that puts in perspective what is before\\nthem. They must come together or literally starve. Gasps are heard as\\nhe touches Kutchra (the outcast), but hearts are changed and tears flow\\nas one who has never known acceptance is welcomed as a key member. (As\\na Christian, I saw a powerful illustration here of the love and\\nacceptance Jesus Christ offers.) Later, facing what appears to be\\ncertain defeat, the women of the village unite before their temple and\\nbegin to sing a song of worship to Krishna --a prayer for intervention.\\nThe scene is stirring: the devotion and trust in a deity is a turning\\npoint for their despair and catalyzes their spirits to face the\\nchallenge the next morning. If only every church possessed faith and\\nworship so innocent, transparent, and 'authentic.' Even the coming\\nmonsoon rain carries a spiritual message of hope. Is God somehow\\ndispleased with them? The villagers' luck changes as the movie begins\\nwith drought but ends with a downpour.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nAn ambitious epic pitting poor Indian villagers against the British Raj\\nin 1890s India, this film is clearly a Bollywood product, although it\\nmanages to transcend some of the Bollywood formulas. Khan, who also\\nproduced, is the studly Indian farmer who has both wide-eyed Singh and\\nsexually frustrated Shelley falling for his charms. Although nearly\\nfour hours in length, it never drags. The musical numbers are very well\\nexecuted, featuring tuneful songs and energetic choreography. Although\\ncricket is not the most exciting of sports, Gowarkier deserves credit\\nfor making the long, climactic cricket match compelling and believable.\\nBlackthorne makes a good villain.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nMy whole family loved this movie--11 and 17 year old sons, myself and\\nmy husband. It's a 19th century fable, the story of how a scraggly\\nbunch of peasants--including a cripple, a mute, a chicken farmer, and a\\ncrazy holy man--unite to defend their village against the British. It\\nalso gives a glimpse of how all Indians--from rajas to Muslims to\\nuntouchables--even English women--lived under the boot of Anglo power.\\nBut the movie doesn't preach; it entertains and moves the viewer. It is\\nvisually varied and colorful, with glimpses of scenic countryside,\\nvillage huts, and palaces. And the musical part of the movie is well-\\nbalanced with the drama, full of lively rhythms, singing, and great\\ndancing. Our real reason, however, for loving this movie is that it is\\ntruly a quintessential underdogs-unite and-fight-back kind of story\\nwhich anyone with a heart will love.\\n\",\n",

       " u\"\\nWhen you watch this film, you'll understand why it was nominated for an\\nacademy award. Bollywood's go-to-guy for proper acting Aamir Khan plays\\na rebellious Bhuvan, a young lad who is tired of being oppressed by the\\nBritish and dreams of liberating everything Indian one way or another.\\nGracy Singh plays the country bumpkin, Gauri who has fallen in love\\nwith him but must first fight off the affections and intentions of a\\nwell-to-do socialite named Elizabeth Russell (played by the L-Word's\\nRachel Shelley) who also becomes smitten with Bhuvan when she comes to\\nhelp the villagers prepare for a mandatory cricket match they must play\\nagainst an elite team that includes her brother, Captain Andrew Russell\\n(played by Paul Blackthorne) who has crossed paths with Bhuvan one time\\ntoo many. Bhuvan, the cause of this dangerous wager must now step up to\\nthe plate, in assembling a team that will play the elite, as he was the\\none responsible for the suggestion of the match in the first place (he\\nbelittled the game of cricket) in front of Captain Russell one day and\\nRussell, obviously did not take that lightly. Look for strong\\nperformances by Aamir Khan of course, Rachel Shelley, Suhasini Mulay\\nand Kulbhushan Kharbanda. Gracy Singh's whining/bickering performance\\nis too irritating to be considered anything special, she nearly ruined\\nthe movie for me and I doubt I will be able to stand her in anything\\nelse after seeing her over-consciously play the character of Gauri so\\nwooden and exaggeratedly upsetting. My favourite song 'Radha Kaise Na\\nJale' unfortunately suffers badly at the hands of Ms. Singh but luckily\\nmy love affair with the song began long before my eyes met its\\ninterpretation on her and Aamir in the film. Anyways, some key scenes\\ninclude; a scene in which a bunch of villagers discriminate against a\\nman of lower caste (a so-called untouchable) during the team selection\\nprocess. Other highlights include the scene in which Rachel Shelley is\\ndressed up in Indian attire, the cricket match itself and the rain\\nanticipation scene.

       " u\"\\nOne movie that should have won the Oscar but it didn't. A small village\\nin British India is overdue in taxes. But due to lack of rain, there is\\nno crops, so no money and hence no taxes. the British Raj gets\\nimpatient, and demands taxes. The village persons desperate, wants to\\nmake a deal. And so a deal is signed. the Deal - A Cricket match\\nbetween the team of the British raj and the illiterate Indians. If the\\nBritish win the Indians have to pay the double tax, but if it happens\\nthe other way around, the villagers won't have to pay any taxes. A\\nlucrative offer and the naive villagers fall for it. (Considering the\\nfact that they don't know a thing about cricket) The British confident\\nof their success, are in the cool. The Indians start practicing the\\nforeign game. Soon they have their eleven. In the midst of betrayals\\nthe game starts. The British post a huge total, but the Indians fight\\nback. The team captain, being their spirit of hope. The irony is in the\\nfact with only 1 ball remaining six runs are needed, for victory with\\nthe Jack (Who incidentally is a cripple) facing a fast bowler, the lead\\nbowler. He fails managing only a single. The British rejoice in the\\nvictory. The Indians lie down with their heads hung in shame. But the\\numpire surprises everybody by stating there has been a no ball. The\\nbowler goes back to his run up. He bowls but he is bowling to the\\ncaptain, the unbeaten batsman looking forward to carrying his bat\\nthroughout the innings. He swings and it looks like he is caught by the\\nBritish Captain. Hang on thats not the end. It appears that he has\\ncrossed the boundary. The result the Indians win. The ultimate reward\\ncomes in the end when the rain gods bless Champaran with a shower of\\nrain. The movie revolves in a love triangle between Aamir Khan, Gracy Singh\\nand Rachel Shelly. Shelly a British lady takes up in training the\\nIndians the game of cricket, in turn she falls for the handsome Bhuvan\\n(Aamir), the captain of the village team. Bhuvan in turn loves Gauri\\n(Gracy Singh), a simple village girl. The music is superb and the songs are very soothing. Lagaan is one\\nmovie which most definitely should have won the Oscars, a real pity\\nthat it didn't. But the story and the entire theme was very original.\\nThe supporting characters though play a very small part in the movie\\napart from the leading characters.

The cripple, has the talent of spinning the ball\\n(reminds me of Chandrashekhar), Laka, the traitor who betrays the\\nvillagers for his thirst for revenge, and all the rest of the Eleven.\\nEach one of them has a definite purpose in the movie and thats what\\nmade this movie apart from the rest of the usual BS movies about\\nfreedom struggle.

Go to eBay,\\nthere are sellers with the same titles from the same manufacturers, but\\nwith normal prices AND a lot of know-how on the subject ! My advice to\\nall of you, go the the store H2Bcom on eBay. You will feel like Dante\\nguided by Virgil...Enjoy Bollywood !!!!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis film has its flaws, but any movie that can make a three-day cricket\\nmatch suspenseful and riveting deserves a standing ovation in my\\nbook.Lagaan is lots of fun for those used to Hollywood movies.  The variations\\nfrom Hollywood norms range from small (but amusing) to major (but\\nrefreshing).  No Hollywood movie would feature an adult male romantic lead\\nwhose primary criterion for a wife is that she be liked by his mother.\\nAnd\\nno modern Hollywood movie would take four hours to tell this story - four\\nhours that are fun and entertaining, and that pass surprisingly\\nquickly.Yes, this movie has flaws.  Many of the characters are stereotypes or\\ncaricatures rather than people; this is particularly true of the British\\nofficers and the supporting villagers.  The subtitling, so crucial in a\\nfilm\\nthat uses two languages, isn't always perfect on the DVD.  The rules of\\ncricket aren't made particularly clear, so non-cricketers have to make\\nsome\\nintelligent guesses to understand early dramatic sequences.  And some of\\nthe\\nromantic sequences (mercifully brief) made me cringe.However, the novelty of the movie makes it well worth watching.  The songs\\nand dance routines are particularly appealing; they retain Indian\\ncharacter,\\nbut are accessible and enjoyable to Western ears.  And the composition,\\npacing, and cinematography are unusual, hence refreshing to people who are\\nused to standard Hollywood fare.All in all, this movie is ideal for anyone who likes musicals, modern\\nfables, sporting films, or just light-hearted, excellent cinematic\\nentertainment.  \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nI was tired, bored, and not wanting to sit through a nearly 4 hour\\nsubtitled\\nmovie.  It was late and I needed my sleep, but my daughter and I decided\\nto\\nat least start the film.  What a delight it turned out to be!!!  In fact,\\neven though it was long past bedtime, we watched the whole thing.Lagaan deals with a late 19th century Indian village under the dominance\\nof\\nBritish rule, more specifically under the thumb of a sadistic British\\nofficer.  In the second year of a drought, the farmers are faced not only\\nwith not having enough food for themselves, but having to suffer through\\ndouble taxes (lagaan) owed to the British.  Their only hope for relief\\ncomes\\nin the way of a bet based on a cricket match, a game in which they are\\nfundamentally ignorant.Despite the film's length, it never drags.  Instead, it beautifully\\nexamines\\nthe will, character, and courage of the villagers in the face of hardship.\\nDon't get me wrong.  This is not a movie that is at all a downer.  It is\\nhighly entertaining and fills the screen with wonderful colors and sound.\\nIt is also a film that seems highly predictable, one that you feel you\\nknow\\nthe eventual outcome of after the first ten minutes, or do you???  I will\\nsay that my daughter and I were startled several times during the course\\nof\\nthe film.My recommendation:  See this film and allow yourself to be swept up in its\\nwonder.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nLAGAAN is really a treat that is not to be missed: a true masterpiece of the\\ngenre and of cinema in general.Masterfully made (excellent cinematography, editing, production design,\\nsinging, dancing, choreography, and acting) this 4-hour long epic stands as\\none of the best musicals and Hollywood-type films I have personally seen in\\na very long time (American studios should take note).Of course the story is a bit on the soapy side-after all it is a musical-but\\nI personally never felt cheated of the genuine feelings I had for the\\ncharacters. LAGAAN is made with such bravura, energy, dedication, artistry\\nand professionalism that one can only but become enthralled by its energy,\\nhumor, lightness, and beauty.See it at the theatre. Support good filmmaking.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nWith no doubt, Lagaan is an excellent film. High on entertainment, morals,\\nproduction values, and emotions.For most part, those that criticize Lagaan are either those that try to put\\nthemselves forward as being more intelligent than the masses, or those that\\ndidn\\'t get the true message of the film.Lagaan is a movie about many things; not just about Cricket. Lagaan is a\\nmovie about a war without bloodshed. Lagaan is a movie about the triumph of\\nhuman spirit. Lagaan is a movie about unity in gender, religion, race, and\\nclass.The movie is not just about a cricket match. India won its independence\\nthrough non-violence, and that concept is mirrored here in the way that\\nChampaner liberates itself from the British occupation. War doesn\\'t have to\\nbe fought with guns; here it is fought with bats and balls.Human spirit is what triumphs against all odds in Lagaan and it is shown in\\na realistic manner. The British were overconfident about their victory and\\nonly lightly practiced; that too half-heartedly. Meanwhile, the villagers\\nspent three months of intensive training, day by day. For those three\\nmonths, cricket was their life; it is what would determine their future.\\nAnd\\nthe moment the final shot of this war is delivered, the triumph overcomes\\nthe viewer, and the viewer is filled with absolute joy. Why? Because they\\ntoo see how human spirit has triumphed against all odds.Some may complain that Lagaan shows the British in absolute negative light.\\nThis, however, is most definitely not true. As previously stated, Lagaan is\\na film about unity. First and foremost, the British in this film are\\nBritish\\nImperialists. Saying that Lagaan is anti-British is like saying that\\n\"Schindler\\'s List\" is anti-German. Additionally, we see how not all the\\nBritish go along with this plan. Captain Russel\\'s sister feels that this is\\nunfair, as do many of Russel\\'s senior officers. And, it very well is true\\nthat many of the British Imperialists at the time were that antagonizing.\\nAdditionally, the theme of unity is brought forward throughout the film,\\nmainly during the building of the team. We see women, such as Gauri and\\nElizabeth, play an important role in the team\\'s victory. We see men of all\\nreligions (Sikhism, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) working together towards\\nvictory.\\nWhen Kachra, the untouchable, is brought forward into the team, what we see\\nis not an unrealistic speech; we see a social message.Most throughout the world view India as a land of absolute destitution,\\nwithout learning about its rich heritage or culture, or what India is\\ncapable of. Even when India proves its worth, criticism is brought about\\n(such as the case with nuclear testing). Lagaan proves to the world that\\nIndia is not as they think it really is. While films like \"Salaam Bombay!\"\\nare truly excellent, they only feed this general and negative perception of\\nIndia.Very well, Lagaan is worth a chance by anyone, no matter where they\\'re\\nfrom.\\nLagaan has been appreciated by foreigners throughout the world, and nothing\\ncan move it away from that.\\n-Rishi J\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nLAGAAN- the last word for determination and passion. Like me those who have\\nwatched this movie know that it\\'s not exaggerating to say so. To describe\\nthe movie in one line it\\'s simply a fight of poor villagers of champaran\\nagainst the freakish nature of the British officials.The movie starts with detailing of each and every thing i.e. the actors,\\nthe situation, makeup etc. all the characters are so real that many of us\\ncan identify someone or the other with the characters. The story tells us\\nabout a poor village Champaren, where there is no rain since last few years.\\nThe villagers are unable to pay tax but the Britisher imposes double\\n\\'lagaan\\' on them. In the meantime, a piece of cloud is seen and the\\nvillagers rejoices with \"Ghanan Ghanan ghana ghir aye badra......\". But\\nunlucky villagers the cloud flies away and then came the news of \"diguna\\nlagaan\". They decided to go and pray to their king to look into the matter\\nand first time sees the British  \"gillidanda\", which was in real means\\nnothing but the game of Cricket. Captain Russell challenge them and puts a\\ncondition that if they beat them in the game of cricket then they won\\'t have\\nto pay tax for three years otherwise the burden of triple tax would be\\nforcefully imposed on them. Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) accepts the challenge but\\ninitially his friends did not support him. Gauri (Gracy Singh) supports\\nBhuvan and gradually support came from the other villagers. Elizabeth,\\nsister of Captain Russell doesn\\'t support her brother as she feels that its\\ninjustice to the poor villagers. She helps the villager to learn\\ncricket.The D-day comes and the play starts. During the play, the cinema hall\\nturns out to be Eden Gardens. With each and every ball it seems that its the\\nIndian eleven playing and every moment you find yourself praying to God to\\nhelp them. I would not mention the result, as the film really deserves the\\nvisit of each and every movie lover. All the actors were very good. The\\nBritish actors especially Russell and Elizabeth were too good and the way\\nthey spoke in Hindi was also very charming, and very close to\\nreality.I don\\'t know much about the technical aspect of films but had heard about\\nsink sound and really don\\'t find any problem in hearing any dialogue. The\\nsongs by A.R.Rahman were really majestic.\\' O re chori...\\' seems to be great\\nspecially the mixing of Hindi with English. Other songs are also too good.\\nNowadays Indian viewers are very much habituated with the locations of\\nEuropean countries. In this film we find that the shots are taken in the\\nparticular village only. One has to admit that the picturisations were\\nreally good. Lastly to end this writing I must say that watching such movies\\nare must because if you don\\'t watch it you are really missing\\nsomething.\\n\\n',\n",

It combines some of the\\nbest song-and-dance sequences in Hindi cinema's history with an interesting\\npremise for a plot, excellent, restrained yet powerful performances all\\nround, beautiful cinematography/camerawork, and manages to elicit from the\\naudience a level of emotional involvement that most films can only dream of.\\nIt looks consistently beautiful, without ever being untrue to its setting:\\nthis is not the beauty of bright primary colours so favoured by the average\\nHindi film director these days, but rather the more muted earth tones,\\ncombined with the earthy reds and oranges of the women's clothes, of its\\nvillage setting. It really does mark a return to the sort of honest,\\nheartfelt, genuine films that the Bombay was known for in the 1950s and\\n1960s, though technically this is an infinitely more assured piece of work\\nthan those films. For once, the dialogue never hits a false note \\x96\\nadmittedly, the use of Avadhi is a bit erratic, but my guess is that was a\\ncompromise between comprehensibility and authenticity, and it certainly does\\nnot jar. The integration of the British actors and the bits that are in\\nEnglish is seamless; the film is often funny without ever descending into\\nfarce of slapstick; even Rachel Shelley's typically \\x91Bollywood' declaration\\nof love, complete with pillared room and flying tresses/dresses, works!\\nSpeaking of Shelley, her role is perhaps my one quibble \\x96 it would have been\\nnice to see her romantic involvement with Aamir's character be allowed to\\ndevelop a bit more. Perhaps the only other critical comment I'm willing to\\nmake is that the plot sort of ran out of steam for the last bit \\x96 the\\ncricket match was very entertaining, but given that there was no way the\\noutcome was going to be any different from what it was (this does purport to\\nbe a feel-good film, after all!), I think it went on for a tad too long. But\\nthese are minor points; nothing's ever perfect, and neither is Lagaan \\x96 but\\nit comes pretty damn close to being a perfect realisation of what it set out\\nto be. Well worth a  (couple of?) watch(es), and I've no doubt this will\\ncome to be regarded as a classic.

Ashutosh Gowariker has shown brilliance\\nof how simply a grand movie such as this can be made.

There is no big sacrifice done to\\nexhibit emotions.The music, oh my god Rahman gave was so apt that even today, 10 years\\nlater it still is one of the best soundtracks of Indian cinema and this\\nwill get better I think with days to come.And for the then first time producer Aamir Khan, all my accolades to\\nhave faith and belief and this story and investing all he could to make\\nit as director Ashutosh wanted it.Whichever country you are from please watch it, it showcases human\\nspirit and the gut in a beautiful way.

       " u'\\n\"Lagaan\" is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we\\'ve ever\\nseen before, and yet completely familiar. Set in India in 1893, it\\ncombines sports with political intrigue, romance with evil scheming,\\nmusical numbers with low comedy and high drama, and is therefore\\nsoundly in the tradition of the entertainments produced by the Bombay\\nfilm industry, \"Bollywood,\" which is the world\\'s largest. \"Lagaan\" is\\nsaid to be the most ambitious, expensive and successful Bollywood film\\never made, and has been a box-office hit all over the world. Starring\\nAamir Khan, who is one of the top Indian heartthrobs, it was made with\\nan eye to overseas audiences.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nLagaan, an epic in itself in the Indian cinema circles, like Ramayana\\nand Mahabharatha are in Indian tradition. The movie defines perfection\\nof movie-making spanning a feature-film length \"The Making\" and a book\\nabout it\\'s making. The idea started in 1996, by Ashutosh Gowariker\\nafter his last movie, Baazi (an attempt at remake of \"Die Hard\"),\\nstarring Aamir himself was a flop.Initially, it was rejected by Aamir and several other actors. Aamir\\nhimself rejected it 2 times, finally agreeing to take it after several\\nrewrites and even volunteering to produce it himself. The casting\\nitself took almost a year. Aamir, Ashutosh and Reena had multiple trips\\nto London to finalize the British cast.I will not delve into the shooting schedule, since a whole book has\\nbeen written about it by Mr.Satyajit Bhatkal.About the story, it is about a group of villagers, in a village in\\nUttar Pradesh in 1893, who are forced to pay double land-tax, despite\\nthere being no rains in that season. When they go to have the tax\\ncancelled, it results in a confrontation between Bhuvan and Captain\\nRussell, resulting in a challenge from Russell to defeat his team in a\\ncricket match to have their taxes cancelled for 3 years, if they win.\\nIf they lose, they\\'ll have to pay triple tax.What follows is:- One person, Bhuvan versus the entire village\\n(admonishing him for accepting an improbable challenge), Britishers\\'\\noppression, creating a team, ignorance of the game on part of the\\nvillagers, ignorance of big-match attitude in players, match fixers,\\nsocial justice, etc. Sounds like a bad-story, but the screenplay and\\ndirection is so magnificent that you will not realize you have sat for\\nalmost 4 hours to watch this epic.Another clinching factor of the movie is the background score and\\nmusic. Very often you find Indian movies with unnecessary dance and\\nsong sequences. Here is one movie, which does not take the pace off the\\nproceedings, but adds to it.The dialogues, accent are perfect penned by Javed Akhtar. The art\\ndirection, choreography, supporting cast are very well in sync with\\neach other.The best thing about the movie is, how the scenes have been visualized\\nby Ashutosh and Aamir. Calling direction as great, fabulous,\\nunbelievable, excellent, etc would be an understatement. It shows the\\nyears of hard-work everyone, from Ashutosh Gowariker to Jhamu Sugandh,\\nhas put in to make this cult classic.Truly a masterpiece!!!!!!!!! Hats off to Ashutosh and Aamir for giving\\nus such a wonderful film.......\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI love this picture, sports movie cliches and all.  But a tip to my fellow\\ncricket-ignorant Americans: learn the rules of cricket before you see this\\nmovie.  Seriously.  The movie explains very little, and you\\'ll be sitting\\nthere saying, \"Yay!  Oh, wait, that was a *bad* thing?\" and \"Oh no!  Oh,\\nwait ... that was good, I guess\" and \"Why does everyone look sad?  What\\nthe\\nheck just happened???\"Still, though, lots of (granted, corny) fun.\\n',\n",

None of those 225\\nminutes are wasted, and I didn\\'t find myself getting bored at\\nall.\\nThe script is fantastic, though it can only be fully appreciated if you can\\nunderstand Hindi.\\nThis is the most non-Bollywood to have ever come out of India for a very\\nlong time. A film as good as this has not left the studios of Mumbai since\\nthe 1950s with \"Mother India\".\\nThe main character is played by the best actor in India right now, Aamir\\nKhan. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, but not\\nuntalenteds.\\nTo enjoy this film, all one needs is a broad mind and a sensible idea of a\\ngood film.

       " u'\\n\\nThe essential hero tale is universal. This story, although ostensibly about\\na man converting raw talent into a winning cricket team, weaves many rich\\nsubplots into its texture including the issue of caste division. I could not\\nhelp referencing my understanding of the \\nstory to other, more Western, movies like Major League (obvious there),\\nOklahoma ( a Curly - like character tries to sabotage things due to\\njealousy), and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (the music in places) and, of\\ncourse, The Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven (a \"warrior\" tries to recruit\\neleven men to fight for a village). The actors and actresses, though\\nprobably not well known in the US, carry out their roles with consummate\\nskill. I would hope to see them in other films as well. \\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nLagaan is truly a unique movie.  I\\'ve grown up watching many Hindi movies,\\nand while I enjoy many of them, most follow a very standard formula.\\nLagaan\\ndoes not.  This movie has a great plot, with the suspense any sports\\nafficianado finds in the bottom of the 9th inning in baseball, after the\\ntwo\\nminute warning in football, or watching a #16 seed keep up with a #1 seed\\nin\\nbasketball.  The movie has wonderful acting, starting with Aamir Khan, who\\nis very well known in India and was focused on making a movie that the\\nmasses (Indians as well as non-Indians) would enjoy.  And the movie has\\nwonderful songs/dance, something that is not new for Indian\\nmovies.I would recommend this movie to those that like Hindi movies, but also to\\nthose that do not like Hindi \"masala\" movies or have never seen\\none.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nI watched this movie on the big screen. Although, most of the movies\\ncoming\\nout of Bollywood (India's version of hollywood) are run-of-the-mill kind,\\nthis one is unique in the sense that it has a wonderful direction and\\nacting. I LOVE THIS MOVIE.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThere may certainly be movies with more telling messages. There may also\\nbe\\nmovies that linger longer in your mind after watching them. But for sheer\\nentertainment, you'd be hard-pressed to look past Lagaan!As one reviewer from England pointed out, the plot seems a little bit\\ncomical, especially from the Western point of view. How can you stake\\nseveral lives over a simple cricket match? Guess if you've ever visited\\nIndia and seen the passion for the game and understood it within the\\ncultural context of the country, you might appreciate the plot as well. In\\nany case, whether the plot is comical or not, what lifts the movie above\\nall\\nelse is the stunning cinematography, flawless direction and incredible\\nacting, by both the Indian as well as the  British actors. There's just\\ntoo\\nmany good points about the movie to be able to mention them all - not\\nleast\\nthe songs and the music!As for the chances at the Oscars, I haven't seen the other nominees so I\\ncannot compare them with Lagaan.

Moreover the\\nacting\\noverall is excellent...This movie has been a blockbuster in India and has appealed to audiences\\neverywhere in the world (rarely does that happen!!). I would like to\\nencourage everyone to go see the movie judge for themselves.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nI think that a film like Lagaan, while good cinema in general, is also a\\nparticularly successful realization set of ideas that differentiates\\nIndian\\ncommercial cinema from films made elsewhere in the world, and that some\\nunderstanding of this background makes it and other films like it more\\naccessible to an audience used to the conventions of Western film-making.In my opinion, commercial Indian cinema (whether Hindi, Tamil, Bengali ..)\\nderives its basic aesthetic parameters from the 'navarasa' theory\\ngoverning\\nthe conception of the  performing arts in ancient India, most famously\\ndelineated in the Natyashastra, the treatise on classical dance. In\\nclassical Sanskrit drama, there is no differentiation into comedy,\\ntragedy,\\netc. Instead, the purpose of art is to achieve the right mixture between\\nthe\\nnine principal 'rasas' (literally: juices) - e.g. love, fear, the\\ngrotesque,\\npity, anger, the erotic, and a few more. Performing art is said to have\\nsucceeded if the right balance is achieved, in which case the viewer\\nshould\\nfind himself/herself in a state of 'ananda' (roughly 'bliss'). (Okay, I\\nknow\\nthis is dangerously reductive, but you get the general idea). The parallel\\nwith the idea behind calling Hindi commercial films 'masala' films is\\nobvious, but whereas that term is usually used derogatorily, I think there\\nis a real, powerful idea behind its notion of spices being blended\\ntogether\\nto achieve the right balance of tastes.Now I'm not suggesting that all commercial Hindi films either consciously\\ntry to do this, or indeed that those (if any) that do often succeed. But\\nthe\\nhistorical and cultural justification in the use of comedy, tragedy,\\nheroism, villainy, etc. in the space of a few reels, as typical of Hindi\\nfilms, derives in my opinion precisely from this. Add to this the absence\\nin\\nthe Indian traditional performing arts of boundaries separating dance,\\nmusic, and acting, so that one artistic form is often an integral part of\\nanother, and you have a clearer idea of why Hindi films are what they are.\\nOf course, often this reduces to a 'formula' for mindless inanity and\\nclich\\xe9s, but when a film or a play successfully grapples with the complex\\nnotion above, the result can be a very satisfying kind of film, which I\\nthink Lagaan - very much in the tradition of early Raj Kapoor films\\n(Awaara,\\nShree 420) , and of films such as Sholay, Ganga Jamuna or Mother India -\\nis.In fact, Lagaan struck me as one of the most perfect examples of the\\nnavarasa idea put into practice that I have seen recently. (Ironically,\\nthe\\nlast film I felt this about was Life Is Beautiful, which of course wasn't\\nIndian at all, but I think it succeeded in striking precisely the right\\nemotional balance, leading in the end to a cathartic experience for the\\nviewer). In presenting a diverse, well-etched out cast of characters,\\nLagaan\\nmanages to evoke a series of different but related emotional responses\\nfrom\\nthe viewer, which does in the end lead to precisely the sort of\\ncontentment\\nthat the ancients envisaged. It makes it all come together magnificently -\\nI\\nthink a lot of Indian filmmakers try this, but it's very difficult to keep\\nthe balance and so few succeed. Lagaan, however, manages to pull it off -\\nhigh drama is tempered with down-to-earth humour (and such humour; its\\nsheer\\nearthiness is a triumph); potential tragedy gives way to romance - but at\\nall times, the balance is maintained so that each episode furthers the\\nnarrative and ensures that the viewer is drawn into the lives of the\\ncharacters (whose very diversity and real-ness is exemplary - very soon,\\nyou\\nactually care about these ordinary but highly individual folk and their\\nlives), their concerns, motivations and the constraints governing their\\nlives, but is never bored, and one's interest in the (admittedly\\npredictable) eventual denouement never flags.Where Lagaan also works magnificently is as an allegory for the struggle\\nfor\\nindependence from British rule. It's foolish to take the film literally,\\nas\\nsome disenchanted viewers have done. Of course the fate of the Empire\\nwasn't\\ndecided on the whims of capricious commanding officers and cricket\\nmatches.\\nRather, Lagaan is best viewed as a symbolic representation of how people\\nfrom different backgrounds, castes and communities came together to fight\\nfor India's independence, a message it gets across with considerable\\nsubtlety but also pretty effectively.Of course, another level at which it operates is a pretty clever comment\\non\\nthe role of race and racism in the world of cricket, which has been an\\nissue\\nfrom the first years when Indians started playing cricket for the British\\nand is one even today (to wit the current power struggles within the\\ncricketing establishment). Lagaan lays a stake to the game on behalf of\\nthe\\nSubcontinent, but doesn't unnecessarily demonize the British in the\\nprocess.\\nIt's also a very amusing introduction to the game for the uninitiated,\\nwhile\\nbeing a catalogue of the main issues in cricket's history for the more\\nseasoned. Brilliant!Thirdly, Lagaan is notable for a return to the original idea behind songs\\nand dances in Indian cinema: to move the story forward, to allow the\\n'unsayable' (whether thoughts or dreams) to be expressed in music. This\\ntoo\\nit does most elegantly, with Rehman's beautiful score, which is\\nsimultaneously modern and folksy. This is something Indian films used to\\nexcel in, but over the years the songs have become gratuitous (of course\\nthey can still be fun, but it helps if they fulfil this role too). Lagaan\\nthankfully reverses this trend.Finally - I can't agree more with the person who said that Lagaan is quite\\ndifferent from Ray's work but is also enjoyable without being directly\\ncomparable to his films (which I love). I had said much the same in my\\nfirst\\nreview. Ray's humanism was on a different scale from Lagaan's\\nmagnificently\\nbroad canvas. Ray's works were sublime concertos, whereas Lagaan is best\\nthought of as grand opera.I hope Lagaan gets a broader international viewership, because I think\\nthat\\nas a finely-made, well-directed, wonderfully-acted film, it deserves to.\\nBut\\nI think it helps to have some idea of some of the things I mentioned in\\nthis\\nreview, which is more a set of observations than a review per se: I\\nreviewed\\nit earlier when I saw it for the first time (I've now seen it three times,\\nand loved it each time). Go watch it, especially if it gets that\\npost-Oscar\\nre-release!\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nWell, to tell the truth, I only  watched Lagaan; Once Upon A Time in India\\nafter knowing that it was nominated for the Oscars. Naturally, being a bit\\nskeptical at first, I thought it was another \"love triangle\" nonsense. But,\\nthis movie showed a high level of professionalism and breathtaking movie\\nproduction skills. Aamir Khan and Autosh Gowikar, has delivered one of the best and realistic\\nmovie about how a group of farmers in a village called Champaner rebelled\\nagainst a raise in Land Tax  imposed by the British. The deal they got was a\\nsimple one, defeat the mighty and experienced English team in a game of\\ncricket and be exempted from three years of tax. The cast was simply amazing, with Aamir Khan delivering one of his best\\nperformances yet. The soundtrack, brilliantly composed by music composer\\nA.R. Rahman was very original,fresh and contemporary of the 19th century\\nIndia. Don\\'t expect people running around trees singing love songs as the\\nmovie exemplifies great movie making realism only. The cinematography was a great technical brilliance. A great production\\nfrom Aamir Khan !! \\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nUndeniably the most important movie to come out of the world\\'s largest\\nfilm\\nindustry (Bollywood) in decades, Lagaan rewrites Indian cinema history. At\\nthe cost of sounding repetitive and borrowing from Pritish Nandy\\'s review\\nof\\nthe same movie in Mid-day (June 20, 2001), \"Our cinema history will now\\nhave\\ntwo eras...Before-Lagaan and post-Lagaan.\"A running time of over 3 hours and 45 minutes, a period drama set in\\nrustic\\nGujarat of the 19th century, a largely unknown (at least hitherto not so\\npopular) cast, an ordinary looking debutante leading lady, a two-flop\\ndirector, no mushy romance, no sex, no violence, a leading star who\\nappears\\nin dhoti.....a sure-fire recipe for disaster? Think again. A sure-fire\\nhit,\\na stunning spectacle of the triumph of the human spirit, and just about\\nthe\\nfinest statement made on behalf of Indian cinema...that\\'s Lagaan for\\nyou.Some emotions are very basic. They cut across cultures, time zones and\\ngenerations. Lagaan evokes those emotions. It touches and activates those\\nbasic nerve circuits that send an electric shudder of exhilaration through\\nyour body, that rush of blood in to your heart, those goose pimples on\\nyour\\nskin. It makes you stand up and applaud, because it stands for everything\\nthat an Indian is proud of. In fact it stands for everything that\\ncivilization stands for. I always wondered if any movie churned out by\\nBollywood would truly capture the soul of India. I was disappointed for\\nyears, because despite the great movies (oh yeah there are too many Indian\\nmovie gems) India produced, there was hardly any movie that embodied the\\nIndian spirit completely. I was also disappointed because the only movie\\nthat came close to capturing what India was all about, was Ricahrd\\nAttenborough\\'s Gandhi. A film made by a Britisher, that came tantalizingly\\nclose to symbolizing the Indian-ness that I was so proud of. Circa 2001,\\nall\\nthat changed. Lagaan changed it all. It made sure I have something to\\ncheer\\nabout.I watched Lagaan for the first time in Bombay\\'s Eros cinema, in it\\'s first\\nweek of theatrical release. When I saw ecstatic viewers run up in the\\naisles\\ntowards the screen, dancing and clapping, I felt the same thrill. I felt\\nit\\nthen and there. This was a completely new style of cinematic Indian\\npatriotism. Understated, yet strong. Stylistic, yet simple. Multi-layered,\\nyet basic.

If you win, all taxes are free for\\nthe\\nnext three years. If you lose, you pay triple the\\namount\\nof taxes due this year.With a hand-picked NSD/Pune Film Institute cast,\\nthe\\nactors and actresses (Suhashini Muley of Hu Tu Tu,\\nmy\\nall-time favorite Raghuveer Jadav, Avneesh Misra -\\neveryone was great) - the team did a riot on the\\nscreen. The UK born and raised Gracy Singh was\\nIndian\\nbeauty to its core.

       " u'\\n\\nI\\'m not a terribly great fan of Indian Film, but this deserves a perfect 10\\nrating! As a foreign film, it is simply genius. I have only truly liked 3\\nindian films in my life, but you can definitely add this to the\\nlist.It was filmed with International standards in mind. Many Indian films follow\\nthe same cheesy storyline, \"Indian\" special effects, and the typical hero\\nwho defeats 30 bad guys at a time. This film did not adhere to that typical\\n\"Indian\" formula. To me, it can compete with the likes of other\\nInternational epics, such as \"Life Is Beautiful\".The director used great song, visual imagery & cinematography, and physical\\naction (the game of cricket) to portray a wonderful story. Heartfelt emotion\\nof despair, hope, helplessness, etc were vividly displayed both by these\\ncinematic qualities and awesome acting on the part of Aamir Khan and Rachel\\nShelly! Paul Blackthorne was a very convincing villain, as well. All in all,\\nit was perfect in the way they presented a real-life situation. Not like the\\ncheesy love stories I usually see in Indian movies.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nOverall a nice presentation, except for one or two typical Cinematic\\nsequences...For instance, when Bhuvan tries to include that 'untouchable' in his team,\\neveryone was against him.. And immediately the moment after he speaks some\\ndialogues, at them, they say they did wrong and thank him for 'opening'\\ntheir eyes... This happens only in (Hindi) movies.And another one being.. while being introduced to the Maharaja, Elizabeth\\nwas introduced that she cannot understand Hindi , but immediately after a\\ncouple of scenes, Ram Singh speaks fluent Hindi to her as if she could\\nunderstand... The songs and location were beautiful, but they tend slow the pace of the\\nmovie..Gracy Singh was brilliant and so was Rachel Shelley and\\nAamir.Re-recording was an excellent piece of work by RahmanWe need such movies in Hindi.. Only then the Oscar may not be a dream\\nanymore..RR.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nEasily the best Indian movie I have seen - no stupid songs or dancing on the\\nsnow-capped peaks of Switzerland - no crude jokes - no unneccessary\\nsidetracking. Captures the charm of rural India to the hilt - it also shows\\nwhat the ruthlessness of the erstwhile British Empire- there was a marked\\ndifference in the empire in the Americas and in India - they came to America\\nto live there and to build it - and they came to India merely to plunder it\\n- they did so for a long 200 years and even today we see India suffering\\nfrom the blows the British dealt it. It also captures the triumph of human\\nspirit - and shows that when mind is put over matter - anything can be\\nachieved - in the tradition of movies like The Shawshank Redemption and\\nChariots of Fire. Just a piece of advice : change the subtitles - they are\\nunintentionally hilarious like the one \"Oh my lovely lassie\" - else this is\\neasily the best Indian movie ever - even better than Mother India or Bandit\\nQueen. \\n\\n',\n",

The aspects of the movie that I really liked were the fight\\nagainst the caste system, which has such a firm ground in Indian society\\neven to this day, and the way people of different religions work towards a\\ncommon goal.  This movie should be used as a source of inspiration by\\npeople\\nto avoid the communal fights which have plagued our societies.I have read many reviews of this movie and amazingly I found a consensus\\namong all \"critics\" that this movie has set a new standard for the next\\ngeneration of Indian movies.  One \"critic\" even stated that after the\\nrelease of this movie, the movies produced by Indian cinema will be known\\nas\\nPre-Lagaan and Post-Lagaan.  The cast and crew of Lagaan definitely deserve\\nall the congratulations and recognition for a job par excellence.

The film has an altogether\\ndifferent story... which is a good thing to see as almost all other\\nsuccessful movies are love stories.Lagaan breathes a fresh air in the indian film industry.It is a technically superior than all other hindi movies.The locations,details,background music ,lyrics,dialogues and songs are\\nbreath-taking(excellent).The actor : Aamir Khan gives a stellar performance... a performance of that\\nquality can only be given by the best of the best.. and Aamir is the most\\ngifted actor around.The entire cast is superb. The heroines are cool.In short, the movie is a \"must see\" .khabc\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nI saw Lagaan at the Regal Multi-plex in Whittier, California on opening\\nnight on Friday June 15, 2001.I liked the movie so much that I went to see\\nit again on Saturday and enjoyed it even more. The picture has tremendous\\nrepeat value. I can see this 3 hour plus movie any number of times. There is\\nnot a single boring moment in the movie. Apart from Aamir Khan's incredible\\nperformance, the greatest asset of the movie is A.R.Rahman's music. He is\\nwithout doubt India's best composer today and in this movie he has touched\\nnew heights. He reminds you of Naushad at his best in films like Mother\\nIndia and Gunga Jumna. All songs are going to be big hits, especially Asha\\nBhosle's number Radha Kaise Na Jale and Lata Mangeshkar's Paalanhaare. The\\nlyrics by Javed Akhtar are extraordinary.They are simple yet rich in meaning\\nand poetry.In story, music and treatment Lagaan sets a new standard for Indian films.\\nAnd it is an entirlely original piece of work which you cannot say for many\\nmovies these days.I could write endlessly about this movie but I am constrained by space. I\\nwould only like to add that the subtitles in English are excellent and all\\nthe non- Urdu and non-Hindi knowing people can enjoy it just as much. In\\nfact, anyone who loves movies will love this one. \\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nMy first experience of Indian cinema, and what an enjoyable 3 1/2 hours it\\nwas too. The oppressed indian villagers must find a way to send the evil\\nBritish and their unfair taxes (Lagaan) packing. A mighty battle? An\\nuprising? A revolution? Yes - but not on the streets - on the cricket pitch!\\nIt seems the Victorian ideal of salvation through sport is alive and well in\\nIndia, and its been spun around to portray the struggle against Imperialism.\\nWho would have thought?To my mind, the basic plot seems fairly comical, but there is enough meat\\nfor serious film students to appreciate the picture as well. The\\ncinematography is first rate, espically of the all important cricket match;\\n the star Aamir Khan has a magical presence (albeit if he looks like an\\nAsian Eminem); and the progressive content - including an untouchable in the\\nteam - is still fairly controversial for Indians.Anyone interested in Indian cinema, I would definitely recommend this film.\\nIt's convinced one very sceptical cinema goer!\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nLagaan is a fresh breeze kind of music by A R Rahman. So different from\\ntoday's run of the mill kind of numbers! It reminds you of good old days of\\npure classical music of 50s and 60s like: Mother India/ Do Aankhen Baarah\\nHaath/ Naya Daur/ Baiju Bawara/ Goonj Uthi Shehnai/ Guide etc. All the songs\\nare superb with excellent lyrics by Javed Akhtar. Udit Narayan is at his\\ncareer's best in many songs. Asha Bhosle and Lata Mangeshkar have sung one\\nsong each and both are great as expected. \\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nSecond time of seeing this epic \\x96 well, at 215 minutes long it doesn't\\nseem that long since the last time! Once Upon A Time In India is a\\nSpaghetti Cricket tale superbly portrayed and presented, and yet now I\\nknow: apart from the music by A. R. Rahman it just isn't my cup of tea.\\nI'm missing a vital requirement in that (for example) I have no hatred\\nor bitterness towards actual or attempted past, present or future\\ninvaders of Britain or any other part of the planet; life's too short.Evil cheating moneygrubbing British rulers and noble honest moneyless\\nIndian serfs in a drought-stricken Indian province in 1893 conclude a\\ndeal to pay no tax for the next three years or be taxed at a treble\\nrate: it all depends which side wins a cricket match. Hope it didn't\\ngive present-day Indian or English wageslaves any ideas; but I suppose\\nas most British passport holders despise the game \\x96 and musicals - it\\nshouldn't make any impression here. It's slickly handled with\\nmarvellous acting, music, photography and storytelling but \\x96 is it\\nstill entirely Bollywood or re-heated Hollywood? I must admit that I\\nprefer the purer simpler films from the past, films like Mughal E Azam,\\nPakeezah or Roy's Devdas told me more and still give me more pleasure.\\nWhy, the cricket match doesn't even begin until after most films have\\nfinished! The usual messages are here, of tolerance and self-sacrifice\\nmixed with a hokey competition plot device which becomes the plot...I\\nmiss the likes of Gene Kelly and Danny Kaye. Most of the songs are\\nexcellent my favourite being Radha Kaise Na Jale delicately sung by\\nAsha and Udit Narayan. I never really liked Aamir Khan especially as a\\nleading man but Gracy Singh impressed as Gauri, a perfect support\\ncharacter. It's Khan's film start to finish and he's seldom far away\\nfrom the screen; he even bowled more than one maiden over in here too.If you understand cricket and are interested in this film's premise you\\nshould watch it - if you've seen it once that's probably enough though\\nsome of the songs bear repeated listening.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\nNot that the Oscars themselves are always right or always pick the best\\nfilms but this movie just isn\\'t that good. Sure cricket may be an\\nobsession in India but that does\\'nt mean that a bunch of villagers can\\nbecome professional cricketers overnight. That is the biggest flaw in\\nthis movie. And how the hell can they get trained in cricket by an\\nenglishwoman? How is it that the hero can become such a great and\\nconsistent batsman in such a short period? It just isn\\'t realistic and\\nbelievable enough despite the great production values. It seems that\\nnone of the characters had a shred of self respect, the way they\\nportrayed themselves. However, there are plenty of other plus points to\\nmake this movie highly watchable for a non Indian. The British cast are\\nexcellent in this movie.India has produced plenty of movies actually capable of winning the\\nOscars but this is just not one of them. Go see stuff like \"Black\"\\ninstead.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\n\"Lagaan\" is so delightful it became an international hit...something no\\nother Indian film has yet been able to do.  Although the more ponderous\\nfilms of master Satyajit Ray won critical acclaim they did not enchant mass\\nnon-Indian audiences as this one has.  Much of the credit goes to the\\nwinsome performance of Aamir Khan whose determined character pulsates with\\nexuberant life.  The usual Indian penchant for injecting songs and dances\\nthroughout is here done judiciously well and in keeping with the ongoing\\naction so that it joyously moves the story along with a great deal of spirit\\nrather than evoking a wince.\\nMy only criticism is that the film needed a few more European or American\\nextras because it was obvious that Indians were pretending to be British in\\nthe British scenes. Altogether a joyously infectious, spirited romp.  Even\\nthe inordinate length was not a problem and seemed to fly by, building to a\\nnice tense climax as the poor Indian team tries so hard to triumph.  With\\nall the charisma and energy of Aamir Khan as their handsome young captain,\\nhow could they possibly lose?\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nit could have been shorter. It didn't seem like 4 hours but the film\\ndid drag in places.I haven't seen many Indian films in my life and know nothing about\\ncricket so the film was hard to follow at times. (I think a short run\\ndown on how cricket is played would have helped) Still, I figured it\\nout.The movie itself is very interesting--name all the Indian films that\\ntakes place in 1893, is about a cricket match between Indians and the\\nBritish AND is a musical AND is 4 hours long! Purportedly this type of\\nfilm is not unusual in India but here in America. Still I did like it.The dialogue (actually subtitles) read very well, the setting is (in a\\nway) quite beautiful and the film is very colorful.On the down side: The acting is (with two exceptions) pretty\\npoor--people either overact (the Indians) or underact (the British).\\nOnly Aamir Khan and Rachel Shelley give out good performances. He's\\ngreat as the lead--handsome, hunky and full of charisma. Good singer\\nand dancer too. Shelley has a role that could have been a\\ndisaster--she's a kind British woman who teaches the Indians to play\\ncricket and (understandably) falls in love with Khan. It's an old\\nstereotype, but she manages to rise above it. The songs are not that\\ngood--there are only 6 and only the first one and an unintentionally\\nhysterical love song in the middle are fun. The others bring the film\\nto a screeching halt and go on forever. The 4 bad songs annoyed me and\\nthe climatic cricket match goes on forever.Still, I recommend this highly. I saw it in a theatre but on video or\\nDVD you can just fast forward through the bad songs and slow spots.\\nWhen this film is doing well, it's just great. Worth seeing--perfect\\nfamily viewing (if you have a kid who will sit through a 4 hour\\nsubtitled film).\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nlagaan is a brave venture and the production team succeeds admirably in this\\nheroic tale of the underdogs. the story is simple, way too convenient and\\npredictable. but what makes it work is the high drama surrounding it, the\\nextraordinary music score and the magical one hour finale.the entire movie is a build up to the final on-field cricket battle between\\nthe rustics who have no idea about the game and the britishers who brought\\nthe game to india. the story in itself holds no surprises, it is obvious\\nfrom the beginning which team is going to win, but the quetion is how? the\\ndrama of the match is simply stunning, with ups and downs. the many\\ncharacters in the game bring a lot of fun and grit and to the game and make\\nit a a delight to watch. an absolute must for any indian cricket fan and for\\nforeigners interested in bollywood. a very well crafted movie. my man of the\\nmatch - a.r.rehman for some brilliant songs and an extraordinary background\\nscore.an exciting 9!\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nI bought this DVD on the strength of 1.) Aamir Khan\\'s fabulous\\nperformance in \"Dil Chahta Hai\", 2.) Customer reviews and 3.) The\\nfilm\\'s Oscar nomination for best foreign language film in 2002. Well, the fact is that Aamir Khan truly does light up the screen in\\nthis outing as he did in the aforementioned. In fact, I\\'d go as far as\\nto say that every moment he is on screen is a delight. Goodness only\\nknows why the Western film industry have failed to recruit this\\nconsiderable talent. He is a gifted actor, is profoundly charismatic -\\nand a great dancer to boot! Unfortunately, he isn\\'t on screen for the\\nwhole 215 minutes. Moreover, his co-stars pale by comparison. (No pun\\nintended.) Be they the simpering girlfriend, the English Rose or the\\npantomime British villain, they are all lacking somehow. Thematically, the film is in the time-honored (fairytale) tradition of\\nthe \"Rocky\" movies but on long-play. It drags to an overly long\\nconclusion. And I hardly think four song and dance routines qualify\\nthis movie as a musical - especially as none of them are particularly\\nmemorable.I\\'ve no idea why the film was nominated for an Oscar. Either it was a\\nbad year for foreign films or the Academy must have felt obliged to\\ninclude an Indian film for once. It\\'s clear why it didn\\'t win.

       " u'\\n\\nWhen you think of how many movies keep you engrossed for three running\\nhours, the brilliance of Lagaan is evident from keeping your interest for\\nall of its four hours (with an interval and some boring ads and trailors\\nthrown in). It could have been a few minutes shorter - but that would be at\\nthe cost of detail, drama, humor, or perhaps a silent cinematographic\\ntransition. Different sections of the audience appreciate different aspects\\nof a film - and a film that can please as many sections without getting on\\nthe nerves of another must be appreciated as a truly complete film. And in\\nthat respect, Lagaan is a perfect example of complete film, a classy\\nentertainer, with superior technical execution - like Sholay (the only\\nother\\ncomparable movie).The strength of \"Lagaan\" is in the people behind its making. Ashutosh\\nGowariker leads the way as a director first, and as much as the man behind\\nthe story and screenplay. Anil Mehta uses color and camera to bring out the\\nmood in each scene. A period movie set in 1893 would rely on sets and\\ncostumes - but limiting the movie to one village called Champaner and\\nnearby\\nBritish Cantonment makes it easier on Nitin Desai and Bhanu Athaiya to\\nsuccessfully take you back by a century with none of the usual faux\\npas.A R Rahman\\xb4s background score combines with Anil Mehta\\xb4s visual brilliance\\nfor a strong audio-visual impact. The songs impress by themselves, and\\ninstrumental notes from the songs work brilliantly in the background\\ntrack -\\nthat keeps you listening and appreciating it from the titles to the credits\\nat the end. The songs blend into the movie with Javed Akhtar\\xb4s strong\\nlyrics\\nand are innovative choreography. There may be some whispers about the songs\\naffecting the narrative but there is an audience that wants to see movies\\nfor the songs and choreography - and Lagaan manages the balance between\\nnarrative and song-and-dance well. About the cast, everyone brings life\\ninto\\ntheir roles. Aamir Khan stands out - with his screen time to movie time\\nratio most likely to beat some of Kamal Haasan\\xb4s movies.Now, about the movie itself - it is a modernized presentation of\\nfour-decade\\nold \"Naya Daur\". It is a movie about common men, led by a strong-minded\\nindividual to overcome resistance and differences in opinion - and standing\\ntheir ground for a cause against a powerful opposition. There is a cause\\nfor\\na fight, there is a fight, and there is a moral victory in the end. This is\\nthe stuff that most good-over-bad and other moral stories are made of, but\\nthe details in the script of Lagaan make it work.The humor built into individual characters as Aamir Khan assembles a\\ncricket\\nteam and respond to the challenge of the British General is most\\nentertaining. At the cost of sounding sexist, some of the ignorant humorous\\ndescriptions of cricket amused me by how close it was to what some women in\\nthe house would say when all men are glued to the TV and households come to\\na standstill (often depriving the women of some boring TV serial). This\\nhumor is certainly a strength of the movie, blended most brilliantly into a\\nserious and inspirational narrative. Full credit to the director,\\nscreenplay, dialogues, and the performers.About the story itself - it is incidental to the movie. Lagaan is more\\nabout\\nspirit, inspiration, and cinematic brilliance rather than a story that will\\nmove you. And should I say, thankfully there is no marriage, no rituals and\\nfunctions, and the stuff that most of 90\\xb4s were made off. The movie works\\nat\\nthe level of spirit and inspiration, and not at some perceived lost\\ncultural\\nvalue in society - and most thankfully so.And to conclude this review - I must say Lagaan and Sholay, being two very\\ndifferent movies share a lot in common - in how complete they are. Think\\nabout this - what\\xb4s so common to these movies.Extra long movies, suppressed societies, domination through power, the\\nspirit to fight, inspiring and building a team, humor and entertainment in\\na\\nserious script, brown barren landscapes, strong people and characters,\\nstory\\nof a single village, and we can keep counting ...So, here I am shooting off a feature by feature comparison of the two\\nmovies.Length and directions - Two \"too\" long movies - where the length didn\\xb4t\\nbore\\nyou. Two directors, who got their formula right.Performances and characters - Sholay was easily better with a different\\ngenre of performers and more complete characters. Lagaan suffers from the\\ntypical \"Kamal Haasan\" syndrome - of centering around one\\ncharacter.The love story - If it were not for the Amitabh-Jaya love story of Sholay,\\nLagaan would be far superior with how the romantic angle never interferes\\nor\\ndisturbs on the narrative.Creating a whole village - Two movies that successfully take you to a\\ndifferent society with pains, pleasures, and feelings that are not so\\ncommon\\nwith what we associate with.Terror - Gabbar Singh scores and its an unfair comparison here. The British\\ngeneral is more about misplaced pride than terror.Humor - Lagaan wins, with humor being a part of its people - unlike Sholay\\nwhich had parallel tracks and comic characters like \"Soorma Bhopali\" and\\nthe\\n\"Jailor\".Visual effects - Technologies have evolved in 25 years, but the brilliance\\nof Anil Mehta in Lagaan is still only comparable to what we saw in Sholay.\\nSongs and dances - Lagaan scores with its songs, though R D Burman could\\nundo all the brilliance of A R Rahman with one Mehbooba.Background music - It would be hard to tell the two apart in how well they\\nserved the movie.Climax - Sholay wins, for the stark and different end - and this is one\\nweakness for Lagaan to be a little more cliched, heroic, and melodramatic.\\nYet, the climax of Lagaan has its moments and tries to be different in its\\nown way. How often has a cricket match formed a climax (without getting so\\nfarcical as Chamatkar, Maalamaal, and the Dev Anand fiasco which\\nincidentally again had Aamir Khan at the crease)?So - for those who still believe that Sholay is the best entertainer Hindi\\ncinema has seen till date, here is reason to rejoice that Lagaan is\\ncomparable if not better.\\n\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\\nI must preface this review with several caveats. First, \"Lagaan\" is Indian\\ncinema, and anyone unwise enough to compare it to Hollywood cinema should\\nreally think twice before writing a review. Indian cinema can and does have\\ninexplicable musical numbers, acting standards that are sometimes at the\\nlevel of a TV movie of the week, and they are LONG. If you know that before\\nyou sit down with \"Lagaan\", you are in for a treat.\"Lagaan\" is a well told tale of the sufferings of a poor Indian village in\\n1893 under tyrannical British rule. The ultimate showdown between oppressor\\nand oppressed is set up early on in the form of a cricket match between the\\nBritish officers who rule the region and the inexperienced, spirit-shaken\\nvillagers, led by Bhuvan. If you haven\\'t seen \"The Longest Yard\", \"Victory\",\\nor even the game in \"The Road to El Dorado\", you are still probably familiar\\nwith the storytelling device of using a sporting contest in\\nallegory.And let me tell you, \"Lagaan\" is shamelessly heavy-handed in its sweeping \\nuse of allegory. Nearly all of the characters might strike you as\\nstereotypical if you fail to realize that they are deliberately allegorical.\\nThe director is not even trying to hide how each person represents an aspect\\nof the overall situation of British Imperial rule, and how each person is\\nalso singularly responsible for representing a significant strength or\\nweakness of the people they portray, whether Indian or\\nEnglish.So if you are looking for Scorcese or Spielberg (or even George Lucas! ha!),\\nforget it. The musical numbers are sometimes jarring and might even appear\\nsilly to Western audiences, but they have strength and fit into the entire\\nallegorical pattern consistently. I admit that had those songs been omitted,\\nI might have liked the film more.But that cricket game is remarkable. I have seen the same kind of showdown\\ngame any number of times in any number of films. I knew what the outcome was\\ngoing to be. But that game was astonishing and gives the film a strength\\nthat nicely balances out the weakness created by the songs and the\\nridiculous love story. I genuinely suspended my disbelief long enough to\\nbelieve that the outcome of the film might not be quite so happy. When the\\ndirector can do that to a veteran movie buff (and occasional cynic), he has\\ndemonstrated some kind of mastery in his craft.Before I saw this movie, I knew little about cricket. Afterwards, I knew\\nslightly more, but I did understand one thing that really surprised me.\\nWithout making the British unnecessarily sinister or unscrupulous, cricket\\nstill came across as disturbingly unforgiving and even brutal. I understood\\nwhy it is a game many consider to be synonymous with fairness and skill and\\nknowing the rules. And I truly felt the director and the performers did me a\\nservice for my $4 rental fee.Give \"Lagaan\" a chance, and tell me if Aamir Khan doesn\\'t look like a buffed\\nout Indian version of American Tobey Maguire!!\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nThis is the story about the resilience shown by the Indians when they\\nwere under the British Rule. They are already taxed to the bone by the\\nBritish and their cronies, but when Jack Russell announces that he will\\ndouble the Lagaan (tax) from all villagers, they decide to oppose it.So, Aamir Khan seems to be in every Indian film, and every Indian film\\nseems to be three to four hours long. And often for no reason. This is\\nanother one of those.I appreciate the idea of having a film made by Indians about the Indian\\nresistance to British rule. There is certainly more to that story than\\nsimply \"Gandhi\". But the Bollywood way of telling these stories just\\nruins them. Would people fighting against their oppression really burst\\ninto song at random times? No.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\nIf you have it in you to enjoy Bollywood, you could do far worse than\\nto rent this film. With an enjoyable story line and professional\\nacting, it's sure to please. Too bad, though, about the heavy dose of\\nrevisionist history! In fact, this movie's a four-hour long\\ndemonization of the Raj (British rule) that's sure to disappoint any\\nwith an authentic interest in colonial times. The story centers around\\na cricket match wager between villagers hoping to escape taxes and a\\nlocal colonial British administrator eager to out-do himself in\\nproviding a hateful stereotype for the Indian resistance (and their\\ncinematic inheritors). One must wonder at the insecurity of any\\nproducer of so jaundiced and anti-British a screenplay. Not to mention\\nIndia's movie goers. Far too much singing and dancing accompany it all,\\nof course, but between musical numbers the viewer will find enough\\nquality script, acting and scenery to carry it off.\\n\",\n",

The dance\\nroutines were excellent showing that the choreography really doesn't have\\nto\\nbe vulgar for popular appeal - a positive trend.  Another good point about\\nthe songs was they were all filmed in rural India and didn't unnecessarily\\npan-off to the Swiss Alps or London tourist attractions\\n!The story was simple and attractive, it didn't exaggerate the situation or\\ncapacity of the characters.  All in all, excellent and recommended\\nentertainment....a must see !\\n\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\nI had rather high hopes for this. A high IMDb rating (8.3 for Lagaan)\\nshould at the same time never be seen as a guarantee (V for Vendetta,\\nRush, Ip Man to name just a few surprising above-8-ratings) and could\\nbe as deceptive as Academy awards nominations/winners. Im sure ratings\\nand accolades accounts for something, but in some cases, it is hard to\\nunderstand how a movie has grown to be generally accepted as a\\nmasterpiece. For me, Lagaan is such a film. The title (Once upon a time in India)\\nand the length (244 min!) implies an epic. At the same time, the length\\nis a double-edged sword. If musicals with an underdog sport story is\\nnot your thing ca 4h may prove to be quite a feat. I sat through this\\nbut did not like it much. I found it cheesy, sentimental and thought\\nmost characters where irritating. I guess the idea is you should sheer\\nfor the team of mistreated locals. One of the problems is that you\\nnever really feel that their situation is severe, since the film is so\\nfamily oriented and polished...I'm sure a lot of people like Lagaan,\\nthere is a lot of proof for it. For me, it stands as one of many\\nexamples of mysteriously high-rated mediocrity.\\n\",\n",

       " u'\\nGood entertainment, but we should beware that this movie injects subtle\\ntwists that exalt European (i.e., White) supremacy. Ironic, isn\\'t it?\\nFour quick examples: (1.) As with most all Hollywood-formulaic scripts,\\nno non-White group is capable of defeating a White man without,\\nironically, help from another White man. In this case, help comes from\\nthe kind-hearted sister of the megalomaniacal Captain Andrew Russell.\\nNot even an Indian who played cricket with the British army is capable\\nof teaching the game to his Indian teammates! (2.) The Elizabeth\\nRussell character, a White female, incredibly masters the Hindi\\nlanguage in a matter of weeks. Of course, the local Indian farmers\\ncannot seem to utter the simplest of phrases in English. (3.) It was\\nnot surprising to see that even the standard of beauty tilts towards\\nEuropean and away from Indian, by the camera lens work (particularly in\\na musical interlude featuring Elizabeth Russell) and music\\naccompaniment that underscores the appearances of Ms. Russell.\\nPredictably, she adorns herself in a sari to demonstrate yet another\\nconquest of Indian culture. (4.) For the final insult, how terrible a\\n\"resolution\" it is to see that as his \"punishment,\" the evil captain is\\nshipped to Central Africa! Supposedly, he is being sent there by Her\\nMajesty in order to \"tame\" other restless \"wogs of the Commonwealth\". I\\nguess there should be a sequel to show how the sub-Saharan Africans\\nhave been taught (by the benevolent Ms. Russell, no doubt) how to\\nmaster the intricacies of POLO against the oppressive regime of the\\nrelocated despot Captain Russell!\\n',\n",

       " u'\\nI personally enjoyed this movie, it was very well made for its low\\nbudget. It had a lot of singing and dancing and a very good plot. On\\nthe other hand the movie was a little \"over the top\" and was slightly\\nconfusing. There was no need for a spy in the community to tell the\\nBritish what was going on, and there was certainly no need for the\\ngirls to get jealous of each other. Those parts of the movie were just\\na waste of time. Plus the film made me hate the British for 3 hours.\\nThe art of the movie in general was beautiful and fun. The dancing was\\nwell choreographed and the plot was exciting. I would watch this film\\nagain but I would skip a few parts. I give this film a 7 out of 10.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\nNotwithstanding the fact that perhaps Oscar is not the last word as far\\nas the worth of a movie is concerned, I\\'ve no idea on what basis Lagaan\\nwas sent to the Oscar nevertheless!At best, Lagaan is just another movie, or rather, continuous and\\nendless buffoonery for almost 4 hours! This movie is full of\\nstereotypes: ruthless British ruler, \"superman\" hero who has to score\\nthe decisive run in the match, villager who work as informer for the\\nBritish, English woman falling for the village hero (Mard\\nTangewalla!!).. and so on and so forth. The whole cricket match was at\\nbest, irritating buffoonery. In my personal opinion, Jo Jeeta Wohi\\nSikander was a far better movie than this one, and only blockheads\\ncould think that this movie was worth an Oscar!Now the plus point: well, I could at least finish watching this movie,\\nunlike another \"great\" Oscar nomination, Devdaas, which I had to stop\\nafter about 30 minutes of viewing.Note: The story of Lagaan is nothing original either; it\\'s taken from\\nthe movie Victory (or, Escape to Victory), made in 1981.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI was amused at the hype the film created amongst well-meaning Indians when\\nit got nominated for the best foreign film Oscar and found entry into the\\nCompetition Section of Cannes in 2002. It was no mean achievement for an\\nIndian film, in the perspective of the political and other forces that come\\ninto play in the long selection process. Yet, the film was inherently too\\nweak to represent the best in Indian cinema. The strengths of \"Lagaan\" were: 1. Great sound (I do not imply music)\\nrecording and the split of the sound into six channels--one of the best in\\nIndian cinema since \"Sholay\"; 2. Commendable casting of Indian actors who\\nare alumni of the National School of Drama, Delhi and the Film Institute,\\nPune--and not because they are sons and daughters of famous Indian actors or\\nthey won international beauty contests; 3. Good costumes; 4. Some good\\nlilting songs with music of A R Rahman; and 5. authentic\\npronunciation.The weaknesses were: 1. Unrealistic photography--passing dark clouds that\\nhave sharp boundaries i.e., with an umbra and no penumbra, resembling\\nshadows of sci-fi films like \"Independence day\"; 2. A screenplay that\\nignores the development of secondary characters like Gauri, the British\\ncharacters, and Indians who work for the British while these characters are\\nutilized unabashedly and lackadaisically to burnish the main plot -- a look\\nat the character development of tertiary characters of Sergio Leone\\'s\\nspaghetti westerns or Japanese cinema will show the lack of depth of\\nLagaan\\'s screenplay; 4. Lack of detailed research on cricket rules of that\\nera which any serious director would have done; 5. Inadequate and poor\\nsubtitling, with key lines left out and additional lines that appear that\\nwere never spoken; 6. A director who fumbles with editing and camera\\nperspectives on the deer and rabbit sequences and forgets to capture the\\n\"no-balls\" of bowlers on camera, 7 Uninspired editing ... the list is\\nendless.A modest production like Shyam Benegal\\'s \"Ankur\" or any Adoor\\nGopalakrishnan\\'s later films would have won an Oscar because these films\\ntake direction, screenplay, photography, editing and sound seriously to a\\nlevel beyond the obvious importance the producers of \"Lagaan\" gave to the\\nstory and acting. Unfortunately, the films of Benegal and Gopalakrishnan\\nwere never sent to the Oscars by the Indian organizations that choose the\\nrepresentative Indian film to vie for an Oscar..Yet \"Lagaan\" is a good Indian film excelling in certain departments but is\\ndefinitely not a patch on the best Indian cinema today. A film of Mrinal Sen\\n(later period), Gopalakrishnan, Benegal, or Karnad offer better cinema than\\n\"Lagaan\"--though none of these filmmakers could afford the monetary and\\ntechnological advantage in the hands of the producers of\\n\"Lagaan.\"I commend the performances of some players such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajesh\\nVivek and Sri Vallabh Vyas in their poorly developed roles. These are great\\nactors on stage but cinema unfortunately has resorted to casting them as\\nstereotypes. I wish these three are picked up by accomplished directors and\\ngiven an opportunity to express their talent in complex roles. Then they\\nwould give the Amir Khans a run for their money and prove acting skills of\\ntrained Indian actors further. British actress Rachel Shelley was refreshing\\nto watch and may develop into an accomplished actress.    \\n\\n',\n",

It should have been two hours at the most.The Indian actors were good, especially the woman playing Gauri, but\\nthe British ones were terrible! The main bad guy and his sister were\\nawfully bad.

       " u'\\nWhen watching a typical Bollywood film, the first thing that comes to\\nthe viewers\\' minds is an elaborate use of music and a strong theme of\\nescapism in the storyline. Despite having these stereotypical aspects,\\nLagaan was able to somewhat distinguish itself from the so-called\\nBollywood \\'formula\\'. The film takes place in India during the British\\nColonial era which is a setting that is rarely ever seen in Bollywood\\nfilms, while its style of displaying a rural environment seems\\nreminiscent of both Bollywood and Hollywood westerns. Along with its\\nsetting and cinematic attributes, Lagaan also differentiated itself by\\ndescriptively portraying the native culture of India. The variety of\\nmetaphors used throughout the dialogues and songs was able to show the\\naudience what the lifestyle of Champaner villagers was like. Throughout\\nthe majority of the film, it could be seen that superstition played a\\nmajor role in every character\\'s life. With many of the songs being\\nabout gods and goddesses, the film was able to portray a religion-based\\nsociety.In the opening scene of the film, the director was able to give a good\\nfeel for what the presence of the British Empire was like by showing a\\nseries of long shots which portrayed the systematic way in which tax\\nwas collected from the villagers. Also, the crosscut between the\\nmarching soldiers and the expressions of the villagers was able to\\neffectively establish a feeling of animosity towards the British. The\\nshot that cemented Russell\\'s character was in the scene following his\\ninitial meeting with the Raja where he was shown from a low-angle as he\\nstood along-side his subordinate Indian soldiers who in contrast to\\nhim, were all bowing down. This presentation of the antagonist enabled\\nthe director to send a message to the audience by portraying Russell as\\nforce to be reckoned with. Unlike the aesthetic visuals of the film,\\nLagaan\\'s background score seemed very out-of-place throughout many\\nscenes. The film lacked a sense of consistency in the type of music\\nused in representing certain situations. An example of this was seen in\\nevery scene where Elizabeth would enter an Indian environment. This was\\nclearly displayed when she asked to speak to Bhuvan alone. The scene\\nstarted off with low-key, traditional Indian music and quickly changed\\nto a western violin tune without having any transition between both\\nmelodies. Personally speaking, I believe the film should have had a\\nbalance between a western and Indian music theme when characters from\\nboth sides appeared on screen. Though the story of Lagaan focused on the colonial era, there were many\\ninstances where the film lacked a sense of realism. The greatest\\ndrawback of this film was the improbable way in which Elizabeth\\'s\\nemotions for Bhuvan were shown to the audience. Instead of showing\\ncharacter development in Elizabeth\\'s role, the director made the\\ncolossal mistake of showing her fall in love at first sight. This\\nnarrative behind Elizabeth\\'s love for Bhuvan left the audience with a\\nfeeling of vagueness and disbelief. Throughout the course of the film,\\nthe viewers were left wondering why a high society woman from England\\nwho had never interacted with Indian people would suddenly fall in love\\nwith a simple villager such as Bhuvan. Perhaps the most unrealistic\\ndialogue throughout the entire film was in the scene where Elizabeth\\ntells Bhuvan that she never had any friends throughout her life. It\\nseems unlikely that someone of her stature would\\'ve live in isolation.Lagaan presented India\\'s point of view on the colonial era but\\nunfortunately, it wasn\\'t able to relate to western audiences. The way\\nthat Gowariker portrayed the British Empire was too clich\\xe9 and\\nstereotypical. With dialogues such as \"jolly good\", a background score\\nof classical instruments, and the formal style of British dancing,\\nGowariker portrayed a somewhat biased account of what western lifestyle\\nwas like. Though Ashutosh Gowariker slightly moves away from the Bollywood\\n\\'formula\\' it can be seen that his inspiration behind Lagaan\\'s\\ncinematography comes from both Hollywood and Bollywood westerns. The\\nstory of a village being oppressed by an authority figure (in this case\\nCaptain Russell), was a scenario often seen throughout \\'masala\\' films\\nof the 1970s. However, his portrayal of Bhuvan as a somewhat vulnerable\\ncharacter is what separates this film from the typical Bollywood\\nventure. The script of this film required Gowariker to lower a certain\\namount of escapism simply because the film was about a serious subject\\nmatter. Unfortunately, in order to make this film a commercial success,\\nGowariker was forced to keep fantasy-filled songs throughout the plot\\nin order to appeal to the Indian audience. In my personal opinion, Lagaan was no different from the typical\\nBollywood film. Despite Gowariker\\'s attempts to deviate from the\\nBollywood \\'formula\\', it still seemed like a film dependent solely on an\\nescapist theme. The songs in the film took away the realistic feeling\\nof the British Colonial era. With a stereotypical portrayal on western\\nsociety, it seemed like the film went off of Gowariker\\'s bias against\\nthe British instead of factual information of the colonial period.\\nAnother drawback of the film was Elizabeth\\'s infatuation with a man who\\nshe couldn\\'t communicate with. Her nonsensical love for Bhuvan not only\\nmade the film look unrealistic, but also took away from the main focus\\nof the film which was colonialism. The length of the film could have\\neasily been shorter if Gowariker concentrated less on creating an\\narticulate love triangle. With its descriptive portrayal of Indian\\nculture, but lack of implementing realism and a universal appeal to\\naudiences, I give Lagaan 7 out of 10 stars.\\n',\n",

       " u'\\n\"Lagaan\" was a darling of the press; too bad; it\\'s overrated.If you want to see art films from India, ripe with the magic that this\\nfilm utterly lacks, view films by the master, Satyajit Ray.If you want to see a fun, expansive Bollywood flick, pick one with\\nAmitabh Bachchan, \"Coolie,\" for example.If you want to see a movie with a powerful social conscience and\\nincredible amounts of courage, check out \"Bandit Queen.\" \"Lagaan\" is\\ncartoonish and strictly for the middle brow.There are extensive singing and dancing numbers, performed by people\\nwho can\\'t sing or dance, directed by a director without an eye for the\\nbody and its movements.When the film\\'s star, Aamir Khan, moves his shoulders in a typical\\nIndian dance move, he looks so uncomfortable you wonder if he\\'s got a\\ncoat hanger stuck in his shirt.He looks like he\\'s never made that prototypically Indian dance move\\nbefore; given the theme of the movie, his apparent inauthenticity is\\ninadvertently comical. Maybe the stiff British officer would perform\\nthe move with more grace and ease.This is such a shame. There is great dancing in India, with a\\ncenturies-long pedigree. If a movie is going to be seen before\\ninternational audiences, and represent Indian dance, it should not be\\nthis.Other Bollywood movies wear their buffoonery lightly. \"Lagaan\" takes\\nitself oh-so seriously.It wants to be an expose of the suffering of helpless peasants and the\\ncruelty of the British Raj.Thing is, you can see real suffering, helpless peasants in India today.\\nThey are not suffering under the heel of the British Raj, they are\\nsuffering under the heel of Indian policies and cultural norms, like,\\noh, say, the caste system and misogyny. VS Naipaul had a lot to say\\nabout that ...But, anyway. Real life Indian peasants look nothing like the plump,\\nimmaculate, perfectly coiffed, sparkly-toothed stars of this movie.And that\\'s a problem. You can\\'t really make a gritty expose while\\nbanishing from your set the very visible throngs -- visible even to the\\nmost casual of tourists -- in any Indian street -- who looks even\\nvaguely like the people whose plight you are dramatizing and wringing\\nyour hands over.Well, musicals aren\\'t realistic, you might be saying.Well, I\\'d reply, musicals do feature the truth of great singing and\\ngreat dance. When a performer with the talent of Paul Robeson belts out\\na song as great as \"Old Man River,\" you get the point being made about\\nthe plight of African Americans in the South, even if Robeson is on a\\nsoundstage, not on the banks of the Mississippi.No one in \"Lagaan\" can sing or dance, and there are no great songs in\\nthe movie. And Hollywood bothered to costume Paul Robeson in simple,\\ntorn clothing.The excruciatingly bogus peasants of \"Lagaan\" look like some very rich\\nand privileged person\\'s fantasy of what peasants ought to look like.\\nThey look like collectible international dolls, like something you\\'d\\npurchase in an airport before departure. It\\'s all very\\nPotemkin-village-esquire.The Sadistic British Officer is utterly unbelievable. The audience\\nlooks at him and sees nothing but the filmmakers\\' pathetic political\\nagenda. A more realistic character, once less flamboyant, painted and\\ndyed, but more believable, could have been much more horrible.The movie wants to be Joseph Conrad\\'s \"Heart of Darkness\" and ends up\\nbeing a Warner Brothers\\' Road Runner v. Wile E. Coyote cartoon.Because it is so bogus, it is lifeless. \"Lagaan\" doesn\\'t have the\\nexuberant goofiness of less ambitious Bollywood movies. Those movies\\nhave their truth; their truth is the most extravagant dreams of their\\npoorest viewers.\"Lagaan\" is a politically correct dream, and, as such, it becomes an\\nartistic nightmare.Some will like \"Lagaan,\" though. As mentioned, there are costumes\\ngalore, with nary a tear from long use or spot from buffalo dung. There\\nare vapid musical numbers, unencumbered by any connection to organic\\nlife.Aamir Khan, the lead, is gorgeous, and he wears very little clothing,\\nso you get to enjoy his gorgeousness in all its gorgeousness.Khan greatly resembles Tyrone Power. Khan looks like Power, he is as\\nbeautiful as Power was, and he has Power\\'s absence of any apparent\\nquality -- intelligence, physicality, depth -- other than great beauty.Gracy Singh is beautiful *and* a good actress. Let\\'s hope she goes far.\\nFar away from \"Lagaan.\" There\\'s a lot up on the screen. A Big Plot\\nDevice, scenery, and, oh, did I mention the costumes? Ultimately,\\nthough, given its complete divorce from either artistic excellence or\\nthe courses of real life, it\\'s all pretty boring.\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nI do not quite get the enthusiasm.  True enough, the film has very high\\nproduction values -- it looks terrific and sounds great.  But to me,\\nLagaan\\nis essentially a four-hour musical version of Bad News Bears that\\nerroneously thinks is also a profound a political drama.  Also, the\\ncharacters are rather one-dimensional, particularly the bad white folks.\\nPerhaps I would not have been so irked if not for the nearly four-hour run\\ntime.  I have not seen much Bollywood, and I did find the\\ncut-to-music-video\\nscenes, coupled with fact that the actors are not singing their own songs\\n(i.e., there is just one singer for all the women characters and one for\\nthe\\nmen) distracting, but I do not think that was the source of my discontent.\\nI recently saw A Peck On the Cheek, which is also Bollywood, and I thought\\nthat movie was far superior to this one.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThe answer: kind of. Occasionally. But Lagaan is a very flawed film. I think\\nthe Sports Movie is probably the worst cinematic genre, in that there are\\nreally only two possible outcomes in the end. The underdogs either win or\\nthey lose. Both options have been so utterly overdone that a sports movie\\njust can't really be very interesting. Add to that the fact that I know so\\nlittle of cricket \\x96 if you don't, you probably should read up on the rules\\nbefore you see Lagaan (like the fact that you can bean a batter without any\\npenalty whatsoever) \\x96 and that promises a very dull movie. Fortunately, the\\nfilm manages to be pretty entertaining all the way through. And since I\\npersonally broke it up into three different sittings, the length wasn't a\\nbig deal (if I had seen this in the theater, I very well might have despised\\nit). It helps that the film is partly a musical. There are, I think, only\\nsix musical numbers, all of them good, a couple just fantastic (they get\\nless impressive as the film goes on). The musical score of the film is also\\nvery good. And the (Indian) actors are all pretty good, with Gracy Singh (as\\nGauri) being an absolutely stunning beauty.  I hated the way that the\\nBritish were portrayed, though. Yeah, I know, they were pretty awful to\\ntheir subjects at this point of history. But they're so evil, they might as\\nwell be twirling their ever-present mustaches. And the more flamboyant the\\nfacial hair, the meaner they are. There is a lot of semi-frightening `I hope\\nour gods break the backs of the Whiteys!' sentiment flying around the film,\\nand Lagaan sometimes seems like a very hateful movie. It does very little to\\nactually separate the past with the present, it seems to me. And then\\nthere's the white woman. She seems like she might have been added to\\napologize for the rest of the British characters (she has no facial hair),\\nbut she's so poorly written that all of her actions and appearances are\\nlaughable. And the semi-romantic relationship between herself and Bhuvan,\\nthe main Indian character, is an incredibly anachronistic and unbelievable\\nconceit. Not much is even made of it, really, except for a particularly\\nhilarious scene where she joins in during one of the better musical numbers.\\nI don't particularly recommend Lagaan (you might want to buy the soundtrack,\\nthough, or download a couple of the songs), but many may like it much more\\nthan I did. 6/10.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nLagaan evokes emotions by tapping into the Indian psyche.  It distills into\\nfilm the more exciting moments from a cricket game; batters getting\\npummeled, wickets getting knocked over, home runs, centuries, and\\ntide-turning errors.  The film also has droughts, evil British oppressors,\\nand a pitiful Untouchable kid.Unfortunately these symbols don\\'t resonate with my ABCD brain.  Removing\\nthem, Lagaan is left me with flat characters, a simple plot, an undeveloped\\nlovestory, and an awfully long running time.Purely as a sports movie I think Lagaan falls short.  Compare it to Karate\\nKids and Rockys.  There, the competition is not so focused on the\\nwin/lose/tie outcome, but on the heroes gaining self-respect.  Instead,\\nLagaan\\'s Indian team lacked a coach-figure inspiring them to \"do your best;\\ndon\\'t lose to fear.\"  Instead, they had Aamir Khan telling them \"try to let\\nme handle it\"The game-ending scene in Lagaan is about as fulfulling as G.W. winning the\\nFlorida election or Brazil winning the 1994 World Cup.  The outcome hinges\\non chance, not effort.Songs and lyrics are fun but have a major problem: most of the the\\nlip-syncing is not convincing.  You see the mouths chatting in a desert\\nwhile you hear the singers screaming in a closet.  They don\\'t blend well.\\nSave the echo and reverb for the soundtrack CD.\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nTo say it straight forward as possible, a very disappointing film,\\nwasn't even worth a dollar to rent it. I wouldn't recommend this film\\nat all except, for one who enjoys the experience of diversity in film\\nmaking, and long, slow, typical movies and little music skits. This was\\na very slow predictable movie, and was throughout the 3 \\xbd, and more,\\nhours. The storyline seems very similar to kid's movies from Disney\\nrelating to little children playing sports and some really corny soap\\nopera. The whole time I was expecting some in depth, mysterious,\\nbeautifully woven scenes to come in, because it was actually nominated\\nfor an Oscar and was pretty popular ,but, they never came.

It is definitely not a period movie, but emphasises on its\\nsetting to justify a large canvas.

In some aspects the movie was good\\n(photography, camera work, actors roles etc.) but in others this was a\\ndisappointing movie.

Lagaan, truly speaking, doesn\\'t even etch by the Oscar\\nwinner or even Amelie, I feel it was lucky to be drawn in the final six\\nas a nominee. And speaking about the Indian Oscar nominations; I was\\npretty surprised that instead of choosing Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, the Indian\\ngovernment chose another scrap a year later, the result: Indian movie\\nnever got past. Even they could have selected Mira Nair\\'s \"Monsoon\\nWedding\", a wonderful movie, much better than Lagaan. There should not be any false sentimental feelings that Lagaan missed\\nthe Oscar by whisker, in fact in terms of cinematic standards, it\\nstands no where near the past winners, e.g. Cinema Paradiso, Il\\nPostino, Life is Beautiful, The Seven Samurai etc etc. Am I true? You\\nmay differ, you have every right to, but the fact is Bollywood has\\nthree versions of movies, the most boring and dilapidated love and\\nromantic movies, or the gangster movies or the age old\\npolice-thief-politician story. One wonders when the time will come for\\nthe age old Bollywood directors to present the truth and the real. And\\nI am pretty sure they will never send Bavhum for Oscar, instead send\\nmovies like Jeans or Devdas...much of the similie of Indian politics\\nhere too!! My real query is if India really boasts of being a secular,\\ndemocratic and multi-lingual country (this is the only country which\\nboasts of having more than 33 different languages, besides the Hindi),\\nthen why not send the regional movies which are miles ahead in terms of\\ndirection, art, cinematography and story? If there is a rule of sending\\nonly the Hindi movies for Oscar, then why falsify and overstate the\\nword, \"multilingual country\"??? India would have won a film Oscar years\\nago if they had chosen to send movies of the regional languages\\n(especially from Bengal, Tamilnadu and Kerala).\\n\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nPretty actresses and charming musical scenes cannot save this Bollywood\\nvehicle. This is cliched, unprofessional and nearly four hours.

How\\npathetic.This film, apart from being long and boring, is also totally unrealistic.\\nHow easy would it have been to get a low-caste person on the same team as\\nthe upper-castes, and that too, a hundred years ago?

Well, that effort alone (of convincing the\\nteam-mates about playing alongside a lower-caste person) could have been a\\nmovie in itself!The plot is ridiculous, the screenplay is ridiculous, the assumptions are\\nridiculous and the finale\\' is ridiculous.  Not to mention the numerous\\nsongs\\nthat the characters keep breaking into every now and then.There have been some good movies from India that at least had a decent and\\nwell-deserved chance at the Oscars -- Manthan, Pushpak, Nayakan, Salaam\\nBombay...

       " u'\\nThis movie was very well made and it looked fantastic with authentic\\ncostumes, locations and nice songs but the story and characters were one\\ndimensional and cartoonish.  A bunch of misfit peasants beat the arrogant\\nBrits at their own game with a 3-way love triangle woven in pretty much\\nsums\\nthis movie up.  The ending is obvious from the very beginning and hence\\nthere isn\\'t any suspense.  There is some petty infighting amongst the\\npeasants along with some modern day political correctness thrown in about\\nthe caste system but in the end everyone in the village lives happily ever\\nafter.  I much prefer \"Monsoon Wedding\" and \"American Desi.\"\\n',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nwhen i went into the film, i expected the match to end at half time,\\nfollowed by some sort of armed uprising by the villagers to overthrow the\\nbritish, or at least make an attempt. nothing like that. the whole film\\nbuilds up to one long cricket match.the first time gracy singh came on the screen, i thought she would become\\nsomeone else\\'s girl, probably raghuvir yadav. i was shocked to discover she\\nwas the \"heroine\" !!the english actor who was the \"villain\" looked more like a spolt rich\\nschoolboy than even remotely dangerous or evil.\\n\\n',\n",
       " u\"\\n\\nThis movie shall attempt to drag you into the colonial India, which has been\\ncreated in a mould as to justify the movie's weak script, in which of all\\nthe inane things, the British try to settle a row with the Indians over Land\\nTax [i.e Lagaan] with a Cricket Match! Its a combination of sorts of the Baseball movies Hollywood keeps churning\\nout [with the plot of a small town team making it to the big league and so\\nand so), and the various over-glamourised period films. The premise of the\\nfilm is hence utterly ridiculous. It shall drag along for good 4 hours, the\\nsecond half being a supposedly exciting Cricket Match with a nail biting\\nfinish! And oh, the ending is so predictable, the movie, however is partly\\nsaved by the various unknown actors' and actresses' decent performance.To top it all, this movie has innumerable songs which just test the viewer's\\npatience. The makers should know that the international commercial audience\\nshall NEVER accept the mindless song and dance routine that the Indian\\nCinema is infamous for. The direction, though a notch up from the usual\\nIndian stuff is nevertheless bland and uninspiring. Basically, a wannabe hollywood type sport movie set in the colonial era. And\\nwe should of course know here, that Cricket is to the subcontinent what\\nBaseball is to America. On the whole, a forgettable picture, more so because\\nit goes on  for 4 whole hours! No doubt the movie bombed at the box  office across the United States.Better off without it.\\n\",\n",
       " u'\\n\\nSooner or later it had to happen: a movie to score a hit from the world\\'s\\nmost prolific film industry: Bombay. For years we\\'ve been hearing about the 800 or more films churned out by this\\nindustry, which largely remain in India, unseen by the rest of the world. \\nNow Ashutosh Gowaricker\\'s \"Lagaan\" seems about to change all that.  People\\nare going to see his 223 minute musical drama centering on a taxation wager\\nin the form a winner-take- or-lose-all criket game.But how can this or any of these film products be separated from the\\nsocietal conditions of the country from which they come?  World tourists to\\nIndia return emotionally shaken from witnessing the horrid suppression of\\nhuman rights there.   Eye-witnesses of \"untouchables\" without decent homes,\\ndiseased beings begging in the streets, exploited to near-slavery conditions\\n-- all in full view and awareness of the government, church, and upper class\\ncitizenry -- point to a highly divided,  confused, and unjust\\nsociety.Does one just close one\\'s mind to all this, and buy into the fantasy world\\nof \"Lagaan\"?  Are all of these products, in effect, used to distract the\\npeasanty and others from the actual injustices being perpetrated against\\nthem?  The real-life conditions of the country suggest the need for a\\nmassive planetary revolution.  Yet, here we are, blithely humming the tunes\\nand savoring the romance of \"Lagaan.\"For me, there\\'s no joy in Bollywood.  Not until the last vestiges of\\ndiscrimination, supression, and domination are eliminated.  Until then,\\n\"Lagaan\" can well keep what it has to offer.  \\n',\n",

This is the start of\\nabsurdities ...leading to more than an hour of badly photographed\\ncricket , and Englishwoman falling in love with one of the villagers\\nwho happens to look like a Bollywood star ( Aamir Khan ). Of course ,\\nthe chocolate-faced Bollywood boy shuns her for the local village girl\\n.

The first group\\nis\\nNon-Indians who have never seen an Indian movie before and think of\\nthemselves as chic and cultured for liking this one.The other group that loves this movie is the 'Jai Hind' crowd, who are\\namazed that an Indian movie was actually made with technical competence\\n(Note comments like 'amazing production values' or 'high quality prints')\\nAND seen by non-Indians. They are the same Indians that think that the\\nSixth\\nSense is the greatest movie ever made; not because its actually a pretty\\ncool movie (which it definitely is) but because it was directed by an\\nIndian\\nand appreciated by non-Indians.If you want to watch a trully great indian movie watch Pakeezah.
